The two \nsmall ones on the side open to reveal two small bots.  One is pure goodness \nthe other is pure evil.  Knok, the good bot, takes the first swing at the \nevil Skar.  Skar easily dodges and backhands him off a the cliff.  He turns \nto the third pod and opens it revealing a large bot.  It is basically a \nblank.  It cannot move without either Knok or Skar.  It does have it&#39;s own \nname though, Blaise.  Skar laughs maniacally and hops onto Blaise&#39;s chest \nplate.  He leans down to inspect an opening.  Seeing that the opening is \nclear he steps into the hole and transforms into an engine gaining control of \nBlaise.\n\n::SkarBlaise::\n    He picks himself up and inspects his body it is a metallic green.  A nice \ncolor he thinks to himself.  He steps out of the pod and reaches back for his \ngun.  It is in two parts.  The first is a small rocket launcher and the \nsecond is a small laser canon.  Satisfied he transforms into his tank mode \ntossing his guns up the fuse to form one big missile that is mounted on his \nback where a tank&#39;s gun would normally be.  This done he recalls a map of \nEarth he was given.  Seeing no easy way south he heads east.\n\n"}}
