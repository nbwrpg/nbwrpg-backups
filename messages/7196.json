She felt his soft fur against her arms and face and she gently \nhugged him. She smiled and said in a soft voice,&quot; Your welcome. \nAnything for a good friend like you.&quot;  She was just happy to be with \nhim, no matter what, she wanted to be with him. And she wasn&#39;t afraid \nto admit that to herself any more.\n&quot;I understand and what you said made sence.  I should be more careful \nin battle and not try to kill an entire army by myself. Besides, I \ngot most of the moves from you anyway. Your a good teacher you know. \nDespite what you think, you&#39;ve taught me a lot.  About myself and \nabout you. Thank you for that.&quot;\nShe gave a gently squeeze around his thick wolf neck. She was just \nhappy he was alive and thankful to the matrix that he wasn&#39;t mad at \nher.\n\n&quot;If you want, I can get another kill for you.  I figured since you \nsaved my tail feathers a few times, I owed you dinner at least.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Sorry I didn&#39;t get back sooner)\n&gt; \n&gt; (Responding to all posts)\n&gt; Lunarpine looked up at Shadow Wing, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;ve already \neaten,&quot; he says\n&gt; glancing behind a nearby rock where the remains of an antelope lay, \nit&#39;d\n&gt; been a while since the kill, insects were already takeing care of \nthe\n&gt; leftovers.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m glad you found me.&quot; he rolled over exposing his vulnerable \nside.&quot;Take\n&gt; your best shot, I deserve it for how I treated you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He paused waiting for her response.\n&gt; &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that you couldn&#39;t fight at my side, I just meant \nthat there\n&gt; were other bots needing your help more.&quot; He was trying to choose \nhis words\n&gt; wisely to avoid sticking another paw in his mouth. &quot;I&#39;m a wolf, my \nsense of\n&gt; smells better than most bots sight.
