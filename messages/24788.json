Sorry about that. I never knew DarkWolf split.\n\n* Iron Raptor growled from behind her helm as she watchjed the charge \nScattershot was sending interfere with her energy.\nFeeling the kickback as the energy of the explosion was sucked into the beam \nonly to make it stronger.\nThe sword in her hands was almost burning hot, and she was sure that it \nwouldn&#39;t be able to take the heat of this energy for too much longer.\nHer fingers were already cramping!\nIron Raptor concintrated her thoughts and directed them to Prowl while she \nkept the beam going.*\n&lt; Prowl? How are you holding up?&gt;\nJust then the dropping motion of Nemisis cought her attention and she looked \ntowards his crippled form as he came to earth.\nHer scanners detecting that he was still awake but very near to stasis lock.\nPerhaps...it was time to finish him.\n&lt; I think it&#39;s time...to end a threat.&gt; Her thoughts didn&#39;t seem so sure and \nshe projected the image of the fallen Nemisis, knowing that Prowl would pick \nthem up even those those thoughts weren&#39;t directed to him.\nBut so many things played in her mind, about what the impact of what she \nwould do would have on this battle.\nShe would have killed a threat, but then the Alliance would be enraged and \nperhaps finish this battle...by finishing the Maximals.\nIron Raptor sighed.\n&lt; We&#39;ve lost already. We lost the moment Oblitercon took shape.&gt;\nIt was the truth too, and from what her scanners showed, there were enemies \nin the ship. And that the CF had been damaged pretty bad.\nShe glared at the lump on the ground which was Nemisis Enforcer, walking up \nto him before her shoulder snapped forward from the impact of Scattershots \ncharges struck her.\nIron Raptor winced and grit her teeth, biting back the pain. Her eyes taking \na good look around her and seeing all of the carnage and battles.\nAll of the mech-fluid and bodies.\nThis was war. Real war.\nAnd she was sick of it!\nIron Raptor retracted her helm, her hair falling out and down her back, her \nhead slowly turning towards Scattershot, not with a frown, but with a blank \nexpression.\nThe beam had disappeared by now and the blade shimmered as she lowered the \ntip of it down towards the crippled Nemisis, resting the tip just above his \nspark cavity.\nHer free hand rested against her shoulder, mech-fluid leaking between her \nfingers.*\n\n&quot; Scattershot...just how much do Alliance bots value their superiors? Not \nmuch?&quot;\n\n* normal voice, the sword still just above Nemisis Enforcer&#39;s spark.\nDidn&#39;t really matter what his answer was, as soon as he gave her one that \nsword would be through Nemisis&#39;s cavity and into his spark.\nBut it was too bad that he wasn&#39;t part of a gustalt, then she would be \nremoving a vital limb and the gustalt wouldn&#39;t be able to form without, \nsay...a leg.\nIron Raptor&#39;s mint ticked with that thought,  dwelling more on it and \nturning it around in her mind.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
