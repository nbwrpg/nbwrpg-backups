She \n&gt; was panting hard and her lead was dropping from running all over the \n&gt; base. &quot;I couln&#39;t find Kenzo.*pant pant*  So I wanted to come back and \n&gt; *pant pant* help out here.&quot;  She heard noices coming from the CR \n&gt; chamber and looked up at Blackfang. &quot;So, can we keep her? If we do, \n&gt; then it would be three canine bots here. Wouldn&#39;t it be fun? we could \n&gt; run together, play together, be a pack together. What&#39;da say \n&gt; Blackfang? You can play daddy, I can be the baby and she can be the \n&gt; mommy.&quot;  Her little fox kit face was bright with delight. She started \n&gt; jumping and hopping around the room with a new found energy.\n\n\n"}}
