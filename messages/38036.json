Not one to waste \ntime \n&gt; &gt; Frostbite taps a green button. A moment the later the ocean \n&gt; beaneath \n&gt; &gt; Darkfate seemingly egins to bulge before it parts off to the side \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; show a bright circular energy field hoding the sea from falling \nin \n&gt; on \n&gt; &gt; the ship. On another portion of the ship, two small portions open \n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; before two odd looking ships seemingly flying like a vertical \nlike \n&gt; &gt; exit and fire out into the ocean. Each then flys off towards the \n&gt; &gt; surface before they break through and the bottom folds out into \n&gt; &gt; wings. Each one passenger ship then speeds off towards the \nlocation \n&gt; &gt; of the IGL transmission.\n\n\n"}}
