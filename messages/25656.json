A small buck leaps over a fallen log, over to a\npond and bends to sip the clear water, to clench its thirst, before it can\nthough it perks up. Looking around for danger of a predator it does not\nsee. Then it starts to sniff, taking in an unatural scent. Quietly you can\nhear faint screams getting slowly louder and over the first few trees smoke\nrises in twin spires as a cracking sound emerges. Then the buck notices\ntrees start to fly as the noise becomes audible &quot;yeaaahhh, now that&#39;s the\nstuff&quot; a gruff voice shouts as the final trees between the deer and the\ndisturbance rip away to a huge metal semi as it tramples the wildlife. The\nbuck just manages to leap out of the way (i&#39;m not sadistic mind you) as the\nvehicle plows through the pond and on through more trees sending splinters\neverywhere. Then when nearing a clearing of rock and grass it hits a jump,\nsoars ungainly through the air then shrinks and shifts into a grey robot.\nAs it lands near the rock, a large tremor is felt around the vicinity. He\nquickly plunges a fist into the rock until he is shoulder deep in it. Then\nhe turns leveling a gun at the forest behind him. He smiles and with a pull\nof the trigger, a small spinning cyclone erupts from the end and starts to\ntear the trees from the earth. He stops and hoists up a larger boulder, a\ngrinding noise can be heard from his arms as he levels it above his head.\nThen after pressing it for a moment he throws it up, and catching it sends\nhurteling upward to an uknown section of the forest. &quot;Yeah, this is living&quot;\nhe shouts triumphantly. Then spining and turning he reverts back into\nvehicle mode to plow through more forest.\n\n\n\n"}}
