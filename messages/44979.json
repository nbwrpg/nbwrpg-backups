I barely have any time left to myself anymore, and am having\nproblems awnsering all the e-mail, espeacially as a council member (LN,\nyou make our life very rough). Reading through 80 ooc&#39;s a day about\nnothing important is getting very tirring as well. I want to say though,\nit&#39;s been one hell of a ride, I had a lot of fun, and I hope you guys\ncan keep it going, and improve it. Just remember to try and be nice to\nnew people who join.\n\nI&#39;d like to give speacial thank you&#39;s to:\n\nSoulstice: For befriending me so easily, and always being around to talk\nto, for anything from the rpg to wrestling. I&#39;ll miss you budy.\n\nKslawdogg: For being the first person to approach me when I joined, and\nhelp me understand the game, and then for being a good friend for so\nlong throughout it.\n\nAlloran: I know he probably won&#39;t get this, but I&#39;d like to thank him\nfor supporting me, and also being so friendly when I first joined.\n\nAirly: For also being a true friend. I also have a lot of respect for\nyou airly, trying to learn how to play a game like this in a second\nlanguage. I know how hard it can be to learn another language.\n\nYanshosh: I know he may not be able to read it either, but he best\nrepresents this rpg. He was an awesome story teller, and I have my best\nfights with him, as he was always fair, and that made it fun.\n\nAlso thanks to everyone who voted for me back at the election, I\nappreaciated the show of support I received. Again, I had a blast, and I\nam sorry I can&#39;t tie up all my characters, but this letter took me three\ndays to get to. Have fun guys.\n\nPS: How do I get the rpg to stop sending me mail?\n\n"}}
