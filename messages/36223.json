I think almost everyone meant him when they said the bum.\n\n::::\n\nHaving disposed of Dogged, the bot hears someone call him, turning and seeing a sword and shield flying at him. He grabs both, looking briefly to see who had thrown it and finding no one who matched his mental description of someone who&#39;d have these sorts of weapons. He turns, seeing Repungus going at Dogged, and finds a new target, firing his remaining shoulder missile launcher at the debris that Branded was behind while heading toward it.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;rAuq&quot; &lt;rauq@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Cyberwolf, you&#39;ll have to repost with Branding. Interception of \n&gt; weapon fire is frowned upon. =)\n&gt; \n&gt; --- Pacifix / Crossroads ---\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix misses his grab, and a sharp pain stabs into his chest and \n&gt; he grunts. The force of the blow knocks him backwards a step, and \n&gt; almost sets him off balance, and denting his heavy barricade mode \n&gt; armour. He steps back again, and levels his freeze cannons at \n&gt; Arty&#39;s shoulders in an attempt to stop the bot from moving his arms \n&gt; at the shoulder. He fires twice with each arm freeze cannon for the \n&gt; joints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Crossroads notices the strength advantage that the new bot \n&gt; fighting with them has, and yells to the bot, (the bum) &quot;Hey large \n&gt; new bot, (he describes the bot, kinda like &quot;hey you over there with \n&gt; the red shirt&quot; &#39;cept I don&#39;t know what the bot really looks like =P), \n&gt; CATCH!&quot; he transforms into plasma shield and sword mode, \n&gt; launching himself at the bum, hilt and handle ready to be grabbed. \n&gt; (Yan, if bum doesn&#39;t want Crossroads, he&#39;ll just transform again =)\n\n\n"}}
