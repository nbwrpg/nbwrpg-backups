To many bots \nrunning around, he liked to be in places that a bot could move around \nwithout having to swerve around other bots.\nDinobot looked longingly at the doors again but then sighed, there was no \nuse in fighting it...orders were orders.\nHe looked towards Tavatron and snarled...*\n\n&quot;I was...&quot;\n\n* Dinobot shook his head, he was about to say &#39;trying to get away&#39; but \nthought that he had better not. He sighed and looked longingly at the doors \nagain, what he&#39;d give to at least get out for a mega-cycle or two. Then the \nidea hit him, there were rooms in the base itself that other bots didn&#39;t go \nmuch, he looked down at Tavatron again.\n\n&quot; Do you know a place where I can get some peace? It is far to crowded here \nfor my liking.&quot;\n\n* Dinobot wasn&#39;t sure if Tavatron would want to join him, she looked so \nready to spring into action.*\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
