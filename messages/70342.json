His increase in speed was from a reasonable thirty \n&gt; miles per hour up to about fifty where he finds that his resilliant armor \n&gt; serves just as well if not better at the task of doubling as a battering \n&gt; ram.  With this he attempts to push forward, literally trying to throw his \n&gt; weight around.  His sonar was now picking up a ping in the tunnel. A very \n&gt; familliar ping.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Autobots, Maximals, I have a signal bouncing off my sonar detection \n&gt; systems.  If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say they&#39;re comming from \n&gt; Rodimus.  His alloys make a distinctive sound when they bounce off the \n&gt; sonar.  I&#39;m picking that up now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot mans a computer inside Tucsons&#39; cab.  She then looks to a \n&gt; radar screen with the object which the waves seem to be bouncing off of. \n&gt; She turns to Perceptor with a look of hope on her face.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Perceptor, he&#39;s right.  It&#39;s Rodimus&#39;s signals coming through the radar. \n&gt; Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll find him, and we&#39;ll all be safe and sound as soon as we \n&gt; get everyone out of here.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride is swift to join Tallon in firing off a few shots at the \n&gt; insects, and attempts to hit several of them.  All the while snorting \n&gt; loudly through nostrills.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I can&#39;t wait to get out of this roach motel!  Hang in there Talon, I got \n&gt; your back!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; tALON/Perceptor:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Talon continue poening fire while perceptor turnon his auditive devices \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; open fire as well\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Preston Carroll&quot; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, May 24, 2010 11:09 AM\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Into the Darkness\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tucson ceases his fire. With his warning shot made, he rolls forward \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his wheels with the light damage not effecting his engine nor his \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; wheels.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; He wasn&#39;t ready to quit, not by any means. Small damage were like moon\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pebbles under his tires, simply roll with them and roll over them.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The truck continues his relentless push forward.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot; Hit me all you want, I&#39;m not going anywhere except forward. We came\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; here to retrieve our comrade, no matter what slag you throw at us. \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is all we want, nothing more nothing less. We are not here to take \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; over\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anything or anyone. Let us find Rodimus, and bring him home, and we \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; will\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leave you undesturbed.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; talon hold back a moan and she continue to firing gainst the insect \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aliens.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The move foward by Tuscon is successful. Although Talon&#39;s shot misses\n&gt;&gt; &gt; its intended target, it instead hitting high and wide, Legacy&#39;s shot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; finds its mark hitting the insect square in the chest and sending it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; flying back into the wall. It lands with a crunching sound and slides\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to the ground, its optics completely dull.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Meanwhile the rest of the troopers surge foward! however due to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extensive armor plating of Tuscon and his grim determination, they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; push through with only a modicum of trouble. The insects leap after\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tuscon, but thier blades slide inaffectually along his armor, cutting\n&gt;&gt; &gt; only into his paint job, but little else. They are quickly left behind\n&gt;&gt; &gt; if Tuscon picks up any speed.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The road ahead looks clear. all the way to the main chamber about a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; half a mile away where Rodimus and presumably where what the insectoid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; aliens called the misstress resides.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The ground rumbled for a moment, and then a blast of cool air rolled\n&gt;&gt; &gt; down the tunnel, but all else was quiet.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OOC: Sorry, I had to type this one out fast :)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
