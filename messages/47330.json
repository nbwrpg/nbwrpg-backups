I&#39;ll have to lay down a \nfew lines here: He can&#39;t have any powers that could destroy a world, \nin fact, his weapons must be reasonable. If you want to have a \nweapon (or armour for that matter) that doesn&#39;t exist, is perhaps \nslightly more powerful, or that MIGHT cause some problems, you MUST \nemail a council member and then the rest of the coucil will review \nit. None of Apocalypse&#39;s weapons can be anymore devastating than any \nother bot&#39;s weapons which are already in the RPG unless you&#39;ve done \nthat. (which you haven&#39;t)\n\nThe rules specifically state that if you want to bring in a new \nweapon email the council for approval.\n\nIf you want to have a powerful weapon for a storyline purpose, then \nyou also have to talk to the council members. If you want to argue, \nyou have my email address, but for now, you have to post that your \nweapons are normal. By normal, I mean that your fireballs are two \nfeet in diametre at max, and will remain like that unless you can \nconvince me that they should be 25ft in diametre.\n\nAlso, if a council member suggests that your character is too \npowerful, then you should listen. More often than not, they know \nwhat they are talking about.\n\nLast thing for this post, if nobody can see you in the clouds, then \nyou can&#39;t see them in the clouds. So don&#39;t post for your character \nseeing other characters. And please don&#39;t tell me he&#39;s omnicient...\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Hottie4u2have1@a... wrote:\n&gt; he can control his power    so its not gonna destroy a world\n\n\n"}}
