The first part is sort of an introduction, the part after the line is th=\r\ne first time of me actually using him.  And a big appology for violence aga=\r\ninst rabbits!\n\n    A dim, ex-Alliance spark is buried in a dark, Maximal st=\r\norage place.  The spark was that of the one and only Skulletron.  It starte=\r\nd to light up a bit.  Then, it started to float.  It flew around a little b=\r\nit, then saw a hole, big enough for it to get outside.  It flew out, and fl=\r\new all over.  Then, it disappeared in a small explosion of light.  It was h=\r\neading towards the Matrix.  Skulletron&#39;s spark got closer, and closer.  The=\r\nn, the Matrix spoke.\n\n    &quot;Hideous spark!  I can not take you, Skulletron, =\r\nand I won&#39;t.  Now, I must ban you from here, and I shall send you away to t=\r\nhe Vok,&quot; the Matrix&#39;s voice said.\n\n     Skulletron&#39;s spark was sent to a Vo=\r\nk colony way out in space.  They took his spark, and began making an organi=\r\nc creature out of him.  They made him a gruesome killing machine.  And they=\r\n named him Slaughter.  Slaughter still had the mind and memories of Skullet=\r\nron.  Revenge.  Slaughter had to eat everything he killed, to live.  If he =\r\ndidn&#39;t eat within 2 days, he would die.  He even ate energon and sparks.  T=\r\nhe Vok were satisfied with their creation, and sent him to Earth.  Slaughte=\r\nr appeared in Canada.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n         =\r\nSlaughter was in a dense forest.  He looked around.  A rabbit!  Slaughter r=\r\nan over, then did a somersault and landed in front of the rabbit.  The rabb=\r\nit stared up at him, and vice-versa.  A drop of slime dropped from Slaughte=\r\nr&#39;s chin and landed on the rabbit&#39;s head, and the rabbit blinked, then trie=\r\nd rubbing the slime off.  Slaughter picked up the rabbit by its neck with h=\r\nis pinsir, then crammed the rabbit into his mouth, and chewed vigorously.  =\r\nThe crunching of bones and guts could be heard.  Then, Slaughter was finish=\r\ned his meal.  Some blood still dripped from the sides of his mouth, but he =\r\ndidn&#39;t bother to wipe it, and let it drip.  Slaughter flapped his wings and=\r\n flew up over the trees.  Then, he began flying off, looking for a bigger m=\r\neal.\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0063_01C0D334.1B6C0CC0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 5.50.4134.600&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#c0c0c0&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;OOC: Sor=\r\nry if the hole is a mode, I needed someway \nfor the spark to get out!&nbsp;=\r\n The first part is sort of an introduction, the \npart after the line is the=\r\n first time of me actually using him.&nbsp; And a big \nappology for violenc=\r\ne against rabbits!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dim, ex-All=\r\niance spark is \nburied in a dark, Maximal storage place.&nbsp; The spark wa=\r\ns that of the one and \nonly Skulletron.&nbsp; It started to light up a bit.=\r\n&nbsp; Then, it started to \nfloat.&nbsp; It flew around a little bit, then =\r\nsaw a hole, big enough for it to \nget outside.&nbsp; It flew out, and flew =\r\nall over.&nbsp; Then, it disappeared in \na small explosion of light.&nbsp; =\r\nIt was heading towards the Matrix.&nbsp; \nSkulletron&#39;s spark got closer, an=\r\nd closer.&nbsp; Then, the Matrix \nspoke.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; &quot;Hideous spark!&nbsp; I can not \ntake you, Skulletron, and I won&#39;t=\r\n.&nbsp; Now, I must ban you from here, and I \nshall send you away to the Vo=\r\nk,&quot; the Matrix&#39;s voice said.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; Skulletron&#39;s spark was \nsent to a Vok colony way out in space.&nbsp; The=\r\ny took his spark, and began \nmaking an organic creature out of him.&nbsp; T=\r\nhey made him a gruesome killing \nmachine.&nbsp; And they named him Slaughte=\r\nr.&nbsp; Slaughter still had the mind \nand memories of Skulletron.&nbsp; Re=\r\nvenge.&nbsp; Slaughter had to eat everything \nhe killed, to live.&nbsp; If =\r\nhe didn&#39;t eat within 2 days, he would die.&nbsp; He \neven ate energon and s=\r\nparks.&nbsp; The Vok were satisfied with their creation, \nand sent him to E=\r\narth.&nbsp; Slaughter appeared in Canada.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial \nsize=3D2&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; \nSlaughter was in a dense forest.&nbsp; He looked around.&nbsp; A rabbit=\r\n!&nbsp; \nSlaughter ran over, then did&nbsp;a somersault and landed in front=\r\n of the \nrabbit.&nbsp; The rabbit stared up at him, and vice-versa.&nbsp; A=\r\n drop of slime \ndropped from Slaughter&#39;s chin and landed on the rabbit&#39;s he=\r\nad, and the rabbit \nblinked, then tried rubbing the slime off.&nbsp; Slaugh=\r\nter picked up the rabbit \nby its neck with his pinsir, then crammed the rab=\r\nbit into his mouth, and chewed \nvigorously.&nbsp; The crunching of bones an=\r\nd guts could be heard.&nbsp; Then, \nSlaughter was finished his meal.&nbsp; =\r\nSome blood still dripped from the sides \nof his mouth, but he didn&#39;t bother=\r\n to wipe it, and let it drip.&nbsp; Slaughter \nflapped his wings and flew u=\r\np over the trees.&nbsp; Then, he began flying off, \nlooking for a bigger me=\r\nal.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0063_01C0D334.1B6C0CC0--\r\n\n"}}
