Personally she would rather forget it all, but they \nwere going ahead with all this whether she supported it or not.\nShe had once thought she had mattered, but she didn&#39;t believe that anymore.  \n   Her troops were considerit but if they didn&#39;t fight or did what they \nwanted they turned on her and left her to stand there alone.  It hurt, and \nbad but she never showed it. She couldn&#39;t because she didn&#39;t know how.\nBut the cold look in Prowl&#39;s eyes gave her the final indication and then \nisolated and painful feeling that was growing in her spark flaired.*\n\n&quot; Then do it.&quot;\n\n* She replied softly before turning her back on Prowl and the rest of them, \nwalking away.\nIt sucked feeling helpless. Hurt too, but she took in a deep breath and \ngathered her wits about her. That was, until she heard a backthough of \nProwls. Wishing that she wouldn&#39;t be such a $%@# sometimes, and even though \nher expression turned hopeless and eys turned empty, she held onto the team. \nThe Maximal team because, even though they didn&#39;t treat her the best \nsometimes, she could always turn to them. But she didn&#39;t know for how much \nlonger.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
