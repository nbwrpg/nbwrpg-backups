With a heavy heart and sympathy for \n&gt; Nightlight, he tries to sit up and then puts his feet onto the ground for \n&gt; the first time since he had gone off line to rescue Rodimus. That spark in \n&gt; his chest, the one that pulsated throughout the duration of the rescue, \n&gt; had not finished pulsating as yet.  He puts his hand on his chest, sensing \n&gt; why and how he could have some of that spark left over after what he had \n&gt; just gone through.  he turns his head over to Rodimus and gently puts a \n&gt; hand on his shoulder.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I won&#39;t sit here and watch Nightlight slip away from you.

But I&#39;m sure the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; others\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; would be interested in hearing your story. Why don&#39;t you tell \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then catch up to us at a later time perhaps?
