Cr chambers, computers, lights, and troops. \nJust what he needed. :::\n\n::: Megatron ::: This is excellent, yes. We are now officially independent!\n\n::: Waspinator, in his beast mode lugging around crates and boxes, ::: Yes \nMegatron, we will destroy the Ark!\n\n::: Megatron ::: Yes, in time.\n\n~~~~~~~~`\n\n::: Set hit Gremlin in his shoulder, but what sent flying across the room \nafter Pheniox lept into the cannon and fired at him. Ra sent a stream of fire \nat Transanulas, who caused a few rocks to crash on him. After a few minutes, \nthe fire stoped and everything was quiet. :::\n\n::: Ominous ::: Set, this was a bad idea.
