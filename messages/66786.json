He had been prepared to\nwelcome his L=\r\nord, but he had not been prepared for the Lord&#39;s actual\nrejection of the we=\r\nlcome party. Jotunn was here on business. That was\nas simple as it could ge=\r\nt.\n\nHe got up on an elevator and descended further in the hidden fortress.\n=\r\nHe had not planned to actually take the Parliament with Wave 1. That,\neven =\r\nwith the best estimates, would have been wishful thinking, and he\nhad not s=\r\nurvived for so long as he had on wishful thinking. Wave 2,\nhowever, would s=\r\nhow his supremacy undeniably.\n\nThe elevator stopped in front of the largest=\r\n door ever seen. It was\nconceived to withstand the worst Minions could pack=\r\n. This was a place\nof the utmost security and the greatest importance. He w=\r\naited for the\nsecurity lock to scan his energy signature and the door to op=\r\nen with a\nvery low rumble and a constant shuddering. He stepped in...\n\n...o=\r\nnly to find the Airtankers going at each other with a card game.\n\n- I say, =\r\nBombtube, that was quite a nice bluff there. Too bad I had\nthe better hand.=\r\n\n\n- Don&#39; make me laugh, Gunrain! I shoulda been mo careful: you can&#39;\nlie! T=\r\nher&#39; was somfin you were up to!\n\n- Stop bickering, you two! You only got lu=\r\ncky for now! Lock-on, girl!\nStart shuffling better!\n\n- Blaming me for your =\r\nloss, Motherload? Yet we all know Skysword&#39;s the\nbiggest cheater here!\n\nJot=\r\nunn took out a pistol and fired once. The shot rang out in the\nhangar and t=\r\nhe bullet finally ended by shooting through the deck of\ncards. The Airtanke=\r\nrs immediately pulled out their weapons and aimed\nat the door. Once they re=\r\nalized who was there, they quickly put it all\naway and stood at attention.\n=\r\n\nJotunn: Well, is this how you get ready? I believe I told the\nCommander to=\r\n have you ready to set out as soon as I got here. Has that\nnot been done?\n\n=\r\nMotherload: My Lord, with all due respect, we are posted in that\nweakling&#39;s=\r\n base, but he has no power over us. He fears us and thus has\nno basis on wh=\r\nich he can give us orders. We answer to you only.\n\nJotunn: And was it not m=\r\nentioned to you I gave the order? Do not mock\nme Motherload; you&#39;re smarter=\r\n than that. You know only I command you\nand would dare issue your orders.\n\n=\r\nSkysword: And what would be your orders now, O Lord?\n\nJotunn: Stand by for =\r\ntwo cycles. Review your weaponry. I have to\ncommunicate with my fellow lord=\r\ns, but should their answer be...\nunsatisfactory, we head out.\n\nA grin came =\r\nacross Skysword&#39;s faceplate.\n\nSkysword: =AD&quot;We&quot;, Lord?\n\nJotunn: Yes... Me t=\r\noo.\n\nHe left them there, had the door closed up, and went back to the\ncomma=\r\nnd center near the frozen surface.\n\n\n"}}
