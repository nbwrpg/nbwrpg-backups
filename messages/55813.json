Razor: My brothers, i have come to a decision. A tough one. I have decided that the nWo is not powerful enough to make a difference in this war. We started to grow quickly, but that leveled off to soon. I have decided to return to Cybertron. I intend to fight the Tripredacus. I welcome you all to join in this fight. Diesel, my friend, are you with me? Diesel: Of course I am. How about you guys? Heartbreak: There is nothing for me here but you guys, and I&#39;m sure the CWF on Cybertron no longer exists. I might as well fight on with you guys. Wolfenstein: I&#39;m sorry, I cannot. I must remain here untill I find the bot who killed my brother. I wish you all the best. Over the next few hours the nWo ship is disconnected from the mountin it was next too and was readied for launch. The ship eventually blasts off, going through the transwarp portal for Cybertron. Wolfenstein runs from the site in beats mode. He was now alone, but still wanted revenge for his brother. Meanwhile a small cargo ship came through the portal, freefalling towards Earth... OOC: With Hollwood Narrator, LurkerAbyss, and MDX not posting I decided to end the nWo and do away with a few chars.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
