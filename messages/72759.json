He didn&#39;t know where it would drop\n&gt; him off but he knew he had a job to do.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; All right, it&#39;s time I picked up where the old dragon left off.  I have a\n&gt; planet to help guard and protect AND NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME OR ANYONE\n&gt; ELSE EVER AGAIN!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With his last words he throws out a thunderous roar.  His pace quickens upon\n&gt; approach of the portal.  He also hoped that if there was anyone on the other\n&gt; side that his voice carried through to the other side, as he roars once\n&gt; again with even stronger magnitude.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTUSCON&#39;s roar echoed everywhere! Even the walls and floor seemed to\nresonate with the sound of it!\n\nHaving approached the portal, TUSCON was standing inside a room\nlooking at what appeared to be a door way. However instead of it being\nconstructed of iron and steel it was composed of energy. It appeared\nsimilar in construction the one that he himself had went through when\nhe was being brought into this base.\n\nThe room itself was fairly non descriptive, basic gun metal grey\nwalls, a few monitors and consoles around the room and, besides the\ndoor that TUSCON entered, there were two others. Other than that the\nroom was barren and quiet, only the slight humming from the portal\ncould be heard.\n\nBIG CONVOY, BREAK and MACH KICK entered slowly behind TUSCON their\nweapons out as they watched TUSCON&#39;s back.\n\n&quot;There are more guards approaching your position.&quot; LONG RACK said over\ntheir comlink. &quot;What ever you&#39;re going to do you&#39;d better do it\nquick.&quot;\n\n&quot;How many?&quot; BIG CONVOY said.\n\n&quot;All of them?&quot; LONG RACK came back. Of course that was probably an\noverstatement, but one can gather that a lot of SHARKTICONS were about\nto rush through the door soon. However the alarms were still going\noff.\n\nCONVOY looked over at TUSCON, &quot;Seems like we got a choice to make. We\ncan face the fire here, or we can take our chances through that.&quot; He\npointed at the portal.\n\nNiether choice seemed to be a good one. Not even TUSCON or BIG CONVOY\ncould stand against MAGMATRON&#39;s full forces, especially if MAGMATRON\nhimself showed up.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
