A branding torch \ndoesn&#39;t cut it - no pun intended.\n\nPhoenix::\n\nThe femme doesn&#39;t give them the statisfaction of hearing her scream \nduring the branding, although several pained grunts escape her \ngritted teeth.  Phoenix knows how to deal with pain, and she focuses \non anything but the burning of her own body to bear the torment in \nrelative silence.\n\nHeartbreak&#39;s treatment is another matter.  As she lands hard on her \nback, memories surface of the things Clawful did to her, and Phoenix \nscrambles away, standing up and backing into a corner.  Trembling, \nthe femme tries to calm herself - there&#39;s no way it could be as bad \nas before, she rationalizes, since HBK doesn&#39;t have claws he could \nspear her to the floor with for starters.  It doesn&#39;t work - her mind \nkeeps superimposing the image of the Rogue berserker over Heartbreak.\n\nFear grips her spark compartment with an icy hand.  Seemingly in \nresponse to the threat, she feels her unstable mutant spark flare up \nand send hot tendrils of energy throughout her body.  Even more \nterrified of her own poorly understood powers than of anything the \nnWo might do to her, she tries to suppress the reaction to no avail.\n\nThe first external indication that something has gone very wrong is \nwhen Phoenix drops to her knees, her arms wrapped around her chest \nlike she&#39;s trying to keep herself from exploding, and that&#39;s not far \nfrom the truth.  Strange energy patterns begin sparking across her \nframe.
