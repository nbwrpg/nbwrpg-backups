He wasn&#39;t quite sure who Nightstri=\r\nke worked for, and was happy for the word up.\n\n&quot;Thank you Lord Elder, I sho=\r\nuld have asked that before I left, my bad. Tucson Prime out.  Sorry Lord Pe=\r\nrseus, it was Lord Elder. I&#39;m glad he contacted me because I didn&#39;t know th=\r\nat Nightstrike wasn&#39;t one of Hydras&#39; men.  But, I still need to question hi=\r\nm of course.  It&#39;s great to actually see you this time, sir.&quot;\n\nHe salutes L=\r\nord Perseus, and then looks over to Talon who smiles back to him.  He had n=\r\not forgotten her.  He had strong feelings for her and was happy to see her =\r\nfor the first time.\n\n&quot; You&#39;re even more beautiful than I imagined before I =\r\ncould see you.  When I&#39;m finished, I&#39;d really like to - well.. You know um,=\r\n get to know you a little better..  Er... I&#39;m not good at this..  Anyway, I=\r\n have to go.&quot;\n\nHe visibly turns a slight shade of red around his optics.  H=\r\ne then gathers himself to prepare to question Nightstrike as to Unicron&#39;s i=\r\nntentions.  He knew he had several things happening at once, and to be a Pr=\r\nime to him, meant he had to be well rounded.  He also felt that Unicron&#39;s o=\r\nbjectives had something to do with the opression that was hovering over the=\r\n planet.  As always, he was curious as to why things were happening.\n\n&quot; If =\r\nit&#39;s all right with both of you, I&#39;d like to ask Nightstrike some questions=\r\n.  When in doubt, seek the answers from unlikely resources...  Something I =\r\nkind of learned on my own.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Kraftlos &lt;kraft=\r\nlos@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; The rest of the base appeared to be secure and Lord Per=\r\nseus lead the team\n&gt; back toward the command center.
