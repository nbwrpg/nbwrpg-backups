They&#39;re right where you left them, since there was no need to move them or anything.\n\nCyberwolf and everyone who&#39;s arguing with him: Necromancer&#39;s size was allowed by council decree back when Necromancer was brought in on the condition that he would in no way use it for battle, only for transport. If Cyberwolf agrees to have Megaton limited by the same conditions, the size thing is fine by me. The rest of the council might have different opinions, though.\n\n\n"}}
