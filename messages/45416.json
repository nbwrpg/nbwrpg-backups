After suffering the loss of both Hoist and Computron, who \n&gt; accidentally combined themselves with the ships computer in an \n&gt; experiment that went wrong, he didn&#39;t want to lose Firedrill either. \n&gt; The ships computer was now controlled by Hoist, and so Pacifix \n&gt; prepares a commlink. &quot;Hoist, open a commlink to the Tripreds.&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; A hologram of Hoist appears infront of Pacifix. Hoist&#39;s voice sounds \n&gt; over the internal speakers, &quot;Sure Pacifix.&quot; Hoist flickers and the \n&gt; mumbles something. &quot;Alright Go!&quot; He says to Pacifix before \n&gt; flickering again and dissapearing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pacifix nods as he leaves, and speaks, &quot;Tripreds, this is Autobot \n&gt; Commander Pacifix. I&#39;m awaiting a report from Diplomatic Liason \n&gt; Firedrill, is he available?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
