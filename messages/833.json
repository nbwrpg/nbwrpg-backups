Sorry. And to CODE, worry about your own\n&gt; characters and not other peoples for a change.)\n&gt;\n&gt; * Carnage growled as she crouched low in the grass surrounding the Maximal\n&gt; base, she was only a few metres from Scourge and some other bot right now\n&gt; but her real goal was to get into the middle of the battle and not it&#39;s\n&gt; fringes. She looked behind her and saw Cyber Claw, it would be harder for\n&gt; the clone to get into the base and into a CR chamber now that there was a\n&gt; shield up.\n&gt; Carnage crept past Scourge and began to make her way deeper into the\nbattle,\n&gt; being hidden by the long grass was an actual advantage for her since she\nwas\n&gt; now picking out a suitable target.\n&gt; Suddenly she spotted one!\n&gt; It was a Predacon, didn&#39;t look too bright but a dumb look sometimes hid a\n&gt; clever bot indeed!\n&gt; She crept up to him and waited in the long grass for him to mosy on by, to\n&gt; her it almost seemed like a drone.

He\naimed\n&gt; the rifle just ahead of the signature and let a mirage of charges go, he\n&gt; smiled to himself as they punctured the vent.\n&gt; Now he meant buisness!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do you love your Mother?\n&gt; Click Here\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/3652/7/_/_/_/957190471/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
