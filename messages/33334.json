Of course you \n&gt; do! Okay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves \n&gt; well because it&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, \n&gt; it&#39;s where you are when you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime \n&gt; to leave the base, it&#39;s also where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got \n&gt; all these cool computers and stuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s \n&gt; where we are right now! Isn&#39;t that a coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s \n&gt; a nice room maybe a little too dusty but then again maybe not and \n&gt; it&#39;s a good room because it has lots of room, and it leads into all \n&gt; of the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the biggest rooms, which is \n&gt; good, because everyone might try to come in at the same time, and if \n&gt; they do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be crowded and \n&gt; the base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might happen \n&gt; like someone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone \n&gt; will get shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t \n&gt; think I did, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong \n&gt; because I&#39;m right. Anyway, I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s \n&gt; your name, I&#39;m not calling you Squawktalk, that would be silly, \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have a nice name, you probably do, but I \n&gt; still hope, because hoping can get you stuff sometimes, and anyway, \n&gt; it&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should be nice because my name is \n&gt; cool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I was trying to say is \n&gt; that maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to the next \n&gt; room? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and \n&gt; we&#39;ll be in the next one instead and I can talk to you in there just \n&gt; hurry up and don&#39;t take forever, okay?...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
