This could\n&gt; &gt; explain his ability to get blown up.  The Spark is\n&gt; &gt; everything.  If it dies so does everything.  Beside&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; if logic were in the head you wouldn&#39;t need it to\n&gt; &gt; revive Waspinator, but they never threw it out as a\n&gt; &gt; useless waist of power.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; it seems like Inferno, Waspinator and Terrorsaur where the ones that\n&gt; always got blown up, they might have been the same type of model or\n&gt; something.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
