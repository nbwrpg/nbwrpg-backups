That bot \ndidn&#39;t know what he was getting into. He looks at Darkmouse.\n\n&quot;Scramble the codes so only you have access,&quot; he syas. Darkmouse nods \nand does as told.\n\n&quot;Excellent. Can you put the engine room on complete lockdown? I want \nit airtight.&quot;\n\nDarkmouse nods, tapping a few buttons. There&#39;s a slight groan as \nevery vent, door, etc closed and shut. Another tap of a button, and \nthe engines shut down, along with all the computers in the area.\n\n&quot;Now, Megatron,&quot; Killfest says over his comm, directly to the \ntyrant, &quot;You are completely cut off. Releasing gasses now would only \naffect yourself. I don&#39;t suggest trying to do anything now, I can \nopen a vent and pump NCG to your position in a second.&quot;\n\nHe motions for Blacknightmare to stop talking to Hell Beast. &quot;I await \nyour surrender, Megatron,&quot; he says into his comm.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;        Hell Beast, &quot;Youre going to have to explain it a little \nmore...Im \n&gt; loseing patience.
