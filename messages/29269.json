The arrow stuck throguh Burning Hammer&#39;s chest with a crack.\n&gt;\n&gt;Burning Hammer: Assassins are people, too! Doesn&#39;t the Maximals have\n&gt;assassins that are designed to kill Predacons, anyway? Of course they do!\n&gt;Say your prayers, Predacon!\n&gt;\n&gt;Burning Hammer takes the arrow out, but mech fluid starts flowing freely, \n&gt;so\n&gt;he puts it back in.

He came to kill a young child \n&gt;who\n&gt;isn&#39;t even here.  We faught to defend the Maximal base!&quot;  As he spots the\n&gt;tree he alters to his bird mode and takes to the air.  The tree passes \n&gt;below\n&gt;his legs and crashes into the base wall above the door.  He lands again and\n&gt;returns to his winged centaur mode.  He once again loads an arrow but this\n&gt;time fires it at Burning Hammer.  He can&#39;t hurt Recon because he isn&#39;t the\n&gt;enemy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
