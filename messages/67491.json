Never in his life had he feared losing control as he did\n&gt; then.\n\nOOC: I am honestly unsure how many of the Dragon Corp there are, nor\nthier speed capabilities. Also I can only assume that since no one\nresponded before when I was verifying positions, everyone save for\nCyclonus, Scourge, Rodimus, Remus, and the sweeps was still at Atlantis\nduring the battle??? Which would mean that all would have some distance\nto make up before they would catch up with Cyc. \n\nAlso I am having to assume that Cyclonus and crew are being shot at\nBEFORE they fade from visual range, but they are moving fast. Cyc is\nnot going to hang around. So please consider my responses an amending\nof my last post.\n\n\nBIC:\n\nIn the air, the fading from view but not quite gone Cyclonus is moving\nswiftly through the air. His body is digesting the new power it has\nrecieved and is enjoying it. Power flows through his circuits as his\nown systems merge with the now corrupted power of the matrix. His form\nseems to radiate a new power, his fusion powered engines thrusting him\nfoward at amazing speeds. He knew he would be able to hold this new\npower, his instructions from Unicron had said as much, but the sheer\npower was almost intoxicating. Internally he smiled.\n\nIt was then that bullets from a gatling gun caught up with him, lightly\nscored his armor and then fell behind as the Cyclonus whipped foward!\nIt was not that the guns lacked power, but simply the speed that these\nships were flying and the distance they were away, by the time the\nbullets caught up they were as pebbles striking titanium shields. \n\nHowerever Cyclonus did have a response as twin missiles errupted from\nbeneath his wings. For a moment the missiles seemed to hover \nas they changed direction orienting on thier target. Then they burst\ninto explosive movement, glowing with encapselated power. Rather then\nmissiles with flame behind them as Cyclonus&#39; missiles looked before,\nthey were now like twin suns as they fairly irradiated power and\ndestruction as they moved toward the source of the bullets: \n\nAs the missiles streak passed, the sweeps fall in behind Cyclonus and\nScourge, forming a protective shield as they pick up speed.\n\nFor the moment Remus is ignored as the Unicronians moved foward,\npicking up speed!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better pen pal. \nText or chat with friends inside Yahoo!
