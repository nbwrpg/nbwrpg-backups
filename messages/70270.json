H=\r\ne could hardly answer Legacy, but does his best to keep his composure while=\r\n quickly approaching the main entrance to the fortress, as it was cleared b=\r\ny Legacy.  He was hurting inside, and it was clear by his moment of silence=\r\n that he was deeply saddened by leaving Rodimus Prime behind.  Yet he compo=\r\nses a reply.\n\n&quot;This- is Tucson Prime..  Rodimus - Rodimus is still inside t=\r\nhe tunnel system.  He - told me to go without him...&quot;\n\nHis emotions were in=\r\nterrupting his train of thought.  Badly heart broken, he knew he just could=\r\nn&#39;t up and leave Rodimus as he had instructed.  No, it wasn&#39;t like Tucson t=\r\no fail on a comrade twice in a row.  First he had a responsibility to get e=\r\nveryone out safely.  He speeds up at the foot of the entrance, stops short =\r\nas he gets there, and opens the doors to all his cabs.  And abruptly breaks=\r\n off contact with Legacy.\n\n&quot;Night Shift, take Perceptor and Windlord out of=\r\n my cab and get them to Legacy!  NOW!&quot;\n\nNight Shift gasps.\n\n&quot;Umm, come agai=\r\nn?  You&#39;re - not gon&#39; back there are ya?!&quot;\n\nTucson Prime swings his back ca=\r\nb toward the outside area.\n\n&quot;GO NOW!  DO AS YOUR TOLD!&quot;\n\nNight Shift rolls =\r\noff with Perceptor and Windlord in towe and soon catches up to Legacy and t=\r\nhe others.  \n\n&quot;Oh Primus no, we don&#39;t need ta lose both our Primes, not now=\r\n! &quot;\n\nNight Shift turns swiftly to face his leader, who is preparing to go b=\r\nack in.\n\n&quot;WAIT YA DON&#39;T HAVE YOUR TRANSMITTER!  YOU&#39;LL GET LOST IN THERE WI=\r\nTHOUT IT!&quot;\n\nTucson replies back.\n\n&quot; I&#39;ve mapped the course using a thermal =\r\nGPS system. I&#39;ll be fine!  DON&#39;T WAIT FOR ME! GO!&quot;\n\nNight Shift turns back =\r\naround and follows Legacy.  His pulsation system was now going a mile a min=\r\nute.  \n\n&quot; Slag, why does he always have ta pull stunts like this?!  It&#39;s li=\r\nke Kup said, Wrecklessness with finesse!&quot;\n\nTucson wastes no time in barrell=\r\ning back in the way he had come out.  He blows his horn to let Rodimus know=\r\n that he was about to attempt a retrieval in the throws of risking his own =\r\ndemise!\n\n&quot; I know you told me to get out but to me, that is completely out =\r\nof the question!  No Autobot leaves his comrades alone!  No matter what sta=\r\nte they are in! I will NOT abandon you Rodimus, I can&#39;t abandon you!&quot;\n\nOuts=\r\nide with Legacy, Rat Trap is now open to Tucson Prime&#39;s signature and his e=\r\nxpressions turn completely grim.  In his tiny little roden eyes, tears well=\r\n up.  He knew that the situation was grave, and fears the worst for his new=\r\nly found friend.\n\n&quot;Wheels!  Lord Elder, This is Rat Trap, Wheels was commn&#39;=\r\n out with the others, but Rodimus told &#39;em ta go, he did, but he just turne=\r\nd around and now he&#39;s gon&#39; back in for Rodimus!  I dunno if he&#39;s gonna be a=\r\nble ta come out in one piece!&quot;\n\nQuickstride thinks for just a moment.\n\n&quot;Dep=\r\nthcharge...  I bet he can help us!  &quot; This is Quickstride ta Depthcharge ov=\r\ner! Tucson Prime&#39;s attempting a last minute rescue, and situation is grave!=\r\n  Need assistance ASAP!&quot;\n\nInside, Tucson&#39;s many wheels turn rapidly as he t=\r\nries to reach Rodimus.  Because of his failure two years past, he tries to =\r\nredeem himself by actually succeeding in bringing out his comrade alive.  H=\r\ne knew the attempt could endanger his life as well, but by Primus he had to=\r\n try.  He sounds his horn three more times, hoping that Rodimus would hear =\r\nhim.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Who: LEGACY, DEEPSTRYKE, PHOBIA, Rat Trap, Quickstride,\n&gt; Location=\r\n: Outside the Black Fortress\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Quickstride knew when to turn tail, =\r\nand this time, he does just as his gut feelings tell him to do. Turn around=\r\n and bolt as fast as his hooves could take him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;On second thought =\r\nLegacy&#39;s right! I&#39;M OUTA HERE!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy slowed slightly as he Quickstri=\r\nde catch up, and then continued\n&gt; on his way towards the exit, his cannon b=\r\nlasting open any doors that\n&gt; stood in their way. It was only a mater of mi=\r\nnutes before they got to\n&gt; the main door, it already being open from when t=\r\nhey first entered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy drove across the fallen door that bridged th=\r\ne lava like a draw\n&gt; bridge and then finally began to slow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tuscon, R=\r\nodimus&quot; Legacy transmitted to the two Primes, &quot;Myself, Rat\n&gt; Trap and Quick=\r\nstride have successfully escaped the Black Fortress,\n&gt; where are you locate=\r\nd?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
