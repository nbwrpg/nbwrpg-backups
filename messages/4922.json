She let out a loud yelp and took \ncover behind a tree near Quickstrike. She looked at him and looked at his \nleg.\n&quot;Your in worse shape than I am. If you will take me wth you, I&#39;ll cover you \nand let you start to get on out of here.&quot;\nShe transformed into bot mode and pulled out an energon rifle. She returned \nfire.\n&quot;Oh, By the way, I&#39;m KitKat.  Nice to meet you.&quot;\nShe fired a few more rounds at the spotted bot.\n&quot;Go on, I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;\nShe kept firing so that Quickstrike could get a head start towards the base. \n  KitKat planned on following him tohis base and use the CR chamber once \nQuickstrike was done wit it.\n\n&quot;Can you make or do you need help? That legs looks very bad.&quot;\n\n\n\n---------Original Message-------\nFrom: Talon Harvilicz  &lt;wilddance_mare@h...&gt;\nDate: Tue Jun 27, 2000 2:39am\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n(Sorry guys, driving school held me up.)\n\nQuickstrike/Cheetor:\n\nQuickstrike was surprised to see another bot coming out of the forest, going\nfor the Maximal. She sounded Predacon, thank Primus. He gave her quick eye\ncontact. She ran at the spot where Cheetor was twice. The third time, he saw\nhim rush out. He heard him growl, throwing his legs out to run. That was\nCheetor? But that thing was nothing but a pile of fur and spots.\n\n&quot;What in tarnation?&quot;\n\nBut after a few seconds some of it made some sense. Before the youth had a\nflight mode, being all metal, he was once a pure cheetah.\n\nHe ran after him. He fired at the youth, at his flank. But the shot went\npast him.\n\nHe saw the youth spin around and transform. He withdrew a gun and fired at\nthem. He fired at KitKat, then three times at himself. Quickstrike nearly\nstumbled. He almost lost his leg from the shot, but he managed to dash to a\ntree.\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
