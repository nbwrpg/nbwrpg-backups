After fully recovering, he finds himself about to eat one of \nGrimlock&#39;s missiles. Too late to dodge, he flinches, only to be \nslammed out of the way by Crotale. He hits the ground and slide, \nboth him and Crotale missile the missile, which heads wildly into \nthe side of the mountain opposite from Grimlock. Pacifix shrugs off \nthe bad landing, and moves Crotale off of him, whispering, &quot;Thanks \nman, I own ya.&quot; He starts towards the decepticons, carefully \nkeeping out of the way of friendly fire. &quot;Barricade mode.&quot; He \ncommands with authority. His second APC connects to his \nunaltered body, adding on armour, and his assault cannons. He \narms his weapons, and prepares to fire. Before firing, he says to \nhis Autobots, &quot;Hold your fire for a second,&quot; then he yells at the \nDecepticons, &quot;LEAVE NOW, OR BE FORCED TO SURRENDER.&quot; \nHe crouches, ready to dodge, and fire.\n\nCrossroads, having recovered from... something, helps Grimlock to \nhis feet. &quot;Uhh, you ok Grimlock?&quot; He refrains from firing due to \nPacifix&#39;s words.\n\nSwoop circles, making a pass at the enemy. He launches two A-G \n(anti-grav, concussion, whatever tickles your fancy =P) missiles, \none at Caliburst and one at Tremor, then follows up with his laser \nbreath, loosing a light show in Tremor&#39;s direction.\n\n\nooC: Nice subtle reminder that you want me to post with my \nAutobots Jer. (Subject is wierd because I was bored.) =P\n\nDewboy, I don&#39;t have much time to post, in fact probably less than \nyou do, or will. You can&#39;t force the rpg to speed up, or slow down, \nto get your posts to happen when YOU want them to. The rpg just \nflows. You&#39;ve got to wait a reasonable time before posting your next \nmessages. Try four hours for a start. To be frank, anything you do \nwith the mutants means little if not nothing to me. I just read the \npost, and if it is good I enjoy it. I only concerns me when rules are \nbroken (or something like that). LN is right, if you want Mustex to \nmove, then you&#39;ve got to post that he starts moving. For your next \npost with Mustex, if he is going to travel anywhere, post that he \nleaves in this sort of manner: (the following is not true, and isn&#39;t a \npost, just and example)\n\n\n::Mustex::\nMustex: &quot;Hmmm, my time here in northern Africa is done. I will \nhave about 2 hours to get to the Infecticon Base and meet with my \ncontact...&quot;\nMustex gets onto his hovercycle, revs his engine, and peels out of \nthe heavy folliage that he&#39;d been hiding in. His path will take him to \nthe Infecticon base. He thinks to himself, &quot;No time lose.&quot;\n\n\nIn the above example, Mustex starts to leave for his destination. \nNow he&#39;s left, you can post for him travelling along the way, or just \nfor him arriving, in several hours, our time. =)\n\nActually, I did respond to your weekly post proposal, and I said \nthat it would probably be ok (I wish you&#39;d read all of my posts). I \nsuggest that you don&#39;t involve yourself in any large battles though, \nthey usually take more than a week to run to completion, and you \ncan&#39;t post everything in two days. What year is your Freshman \nyear? (Canada is different)\n\nI hope you&#39;re still reading. About the Rocak thing. I still want you to \nhold the posting about it, but if what you&#39;re writing about is a \nflashback, and the tech is destroyed somehow, (including the \nchanges that happened to Mustex). How it is lost is up to you to \ndecide. It might be possible for Mustex to retain an ability or \nsomething from the Rocak stuff, as long as you run it through the \nCouncil.\n\nAs far as I know, you haven&#39;t written any profiles for your \ncharacters, and submitted them to the nbwrpg site. To do that, give \nYan the username that you would like (it can be anything) and he&#39;ll \ngive you a password that you can change.\n\nReplying to your ooC banter effective helps me waste my time, \nneeded for posting with my characters. I don&#39;t want to keep having \nto do this. Also, do you have a permanent email address that \npeople (like the council for the most part) can talk to you about \nyour characters, weapons, ideas, and anything else might concern \nyou?\n\nThis ooC has been long, much too long, and I hope I don&#39;t have to \npost many more like this...\n\n"}}
