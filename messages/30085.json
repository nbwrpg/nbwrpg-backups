He then sees\nWildrider, &quot;Report Wildrider&quot;, Wildrider looks around, then starts to\nspeak, &quot;Umm, well sir, a Quintesson has arrived with the Terrorcons, and I\nput them all to work. The Quintesson repaired our wounded, and the\nTerrorcons are hunting down Condor&quot; he finishes smiling a wicked smile, and\nhe is met by a hard fist from Motormaster. The punch sends Wildrider\nsoaring towards a wall. He bounces off, and rubs his face. &quot;You idiot, they\nwill probably rip Condor to shreds&quot; he yells. He wasnt so much upset with\nWildrider, but he was blowing off some steam. &quot;Send Scourge and Cyclonus\nout to make sure the Maximal survives, Oh, and get the Quintesson to fix up\nyour face.&quot; he finishes, disgusted with the large amounts of endoskeleton\nmetal showing on Wildrider&#39;s face. Wildrider salutes, &quot;Yes sir&quot; and walks\naway finishing the sentence, &quot;Your royal pain in the tail pipe.&quot; He leaves\nthe Dark Avian to meet the rest of the robots.\n\nSpeedbreaker climbs into Astroblast, and grabs a big sheet of metal to\ncarry out.\n\n\n\n"}}
