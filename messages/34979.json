An explosion then lands beside them,\nsending Wildrider sprawling. He dosent see his comerade. &quot;Speedbreaker,\nwhere are you, good for nothing&quot; he started to yell.\n\nMotormaster landed a bit away, and spat, disgusted at the Maximals\nclebration. He transformed and rolled towards where the smoke was\nclearing. &quot;Get him in&quot; he said when he found Speedbreaker, and he opened\nhis trailer. Wildrider picked him up and carried him in quickly, then\nstarted leaving, and heard Speedbreaker, &quot;Bastich&#39;s wrecked my paint&quot; or\nsomething like that. He leapt out, and transformed into his car mode,\nand roared off, as Motormaster closed his trailer and followed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSinnertwin swerved back and forth, avoiding a lot of projectiled, and\ncontinued on his path.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMegatron got out of Astroblast. &quot;Well Astroblast, go and tell everyone\nto get repaired, we begin shortly&quot; he said, as he waited for the rest of\nhis troops to arrive.\n\n"}}
