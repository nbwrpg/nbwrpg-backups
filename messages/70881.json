It&#39;s about time we stuck a few arrows \n&gt; up lizard afts tail end.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift chuckles at Straight Shot&#39;s statement, as he acklowledges \n&gt; Perceptor&#39;s downloads.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Gettn&#39; &#39;em now Perceptor. Maaaan talk about heavy intel. There&#39;s no \n&gt; chance I&#39;m gonna get lost now. Hmmm, I might be able ta configure a safe \n&gt; short cut inta the fortress... Any chance ya got the codes ta disable any \n&gt; security software I might have ta know about?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson waits patiently for Cheetor&#39;s news of clear passage as he \n&gt; transforms into his vehicle mode, opening his doors to Lord Elder, and \n&gt; Talon. His engine rumbles at the start yet runs quietly after being \n&gt; started, which was a signature trade mark of his previous vehicle form, \n&gt; who&#39;s engine was barely even heard when standing idol. Night Shift also \n&gt; gets into vehicle form, opening his doors to Windlord and Perceptor. His \n&gt; engine silences after being started yet remains idol.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Night Shift, as soon as Cheetor comes back, and relays the intel, you \n&gt; will slowly advance into position with Perceptor and Windlord. Take your \n&gt; time, we are not rushing into this because the faster we travel, the \n&gt; faster we will raise suspicion. Feel free to take any path you wish. If \n&gt; you wish to go off road, even better. Try not to kick up any dust on your \n&gt; tires if you can help it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Night Shift nodds.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Gotchya. If anyone can roll in silent mode, it&#39;s me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson then turns to Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;If I can get everyone to move in slowly, we have a very good chance of \n&gt; going unseen and unheard. I also plan to send a mild sonar wave which \n&gt; should mask all our signatures, including those of Perceptors, by using a \n&gt; signal configuration code. I haven&#39;t tried doing that but I do know my \n&gt; sonar system can work around various codes and configure a buffer that \n&gt; will not harm anyone who isn&#39;t under our signature. If at any time, you \n&gt; feel that our plan is not working, feel free to intervine&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride then turns to Lord Elder and Rodimus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I should definitely be able to smell trouble if it comes. And don&#39;t \n&gt; worry, I won&#39;t let anyone down. Just to let you guys know, I work better \n&gt; in beast form, since that&#39;s where all my senses are. Well, I better get \n&gt; out there&#39;n start patrol duty. You&#39;ll know where ta find me. QUICKSTRIDE, \n&gt; MAXIMIZE!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; With that he gets into his equine mode and walks out instead of bolting \n&gt; out of the Ark, to keep suspcions low. He sniffs the ground and as part of \n&gt; the illusion, nibbles at a few blades of grass. Yet, his ears remain \n&gt; focused on the task at hand as does his eyes and nose. He raises his head \n&gt; while nibbling, remaining still and doing what horses do best, which was \n&gt; staying still, and occasionally lowering their heads for a few snips of \n&gt; grass.\n&gt;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRodimus nodded as he brought his console fully online. Screens lit up as \ncommunication gear began to glow with readiness. &quot;We will do what we can.&quot; \nHe said, his voice, despite his words, was full of confidence.\n\n&quot;Be careful.&quot; Lord Elder said, his voice, as always the voice of reason. &quot;I \ncan send Rodimus to back you up if need be, but our sensors will not be able \nto track you beyond a certain point. You will be on your own unless you call \nus.&quot;\n\n&quot;But if you call, we will be ready.&quot; Rodimus said, the old enthusiasm \ncreeping back into his voice.\n\n&quot;Cheetor to base!&quot; Cheetor&#39;s voice crackeled over the comm.-channel. &quot;I&#39;ve \ngotten here.&quot; He said, he was obviously out of breath from the travel.\n\nCheetor whisteled over the channel, &quot;You should see what they&#39;ve done.&quot; \nCheetor is not equipped with cameras, but his voice continued, &quot;The base \nlooks totally rebuilt, like some sort of fortified tower, encased in armor.&quot;\n\nThere is a pause, the sound of movement, probably Cheetor, and then he \ncontinued, &quot;There is a small lake of magma here, and the tower is sitting in \nthe *middle* of it. If you can&#39;t fly, you are going to have trouble getting \nto it.&quot; There was another pause, &quot;From what my thermal scanners tell me, the \nsurface of the tower is HOT, all that hot rock sitting near it.&quot;\n\nThe sound of more movement, &quot;Slag!&quot; The sound of movement, &quot;I see one . . . \ntwo . . . three?? Scourge&#39;s flying around here.&quot; He sounded definitely \nconfused. &quot;They seem to be patrolling.&quot; His voice dropped to a whisper, &quot;I&#39;m \nsigning off, I think they can hear me . . .&quot;\n\n&lt;Click&gt; the line is shut off.\n\nLord Elder turned to look at Tuscon as Rodimus stood up trying to reopen the \ncomm-channel, &quot;Cheetor! CHEETOR!!!&quot;\n\nThe channel remained silent.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
