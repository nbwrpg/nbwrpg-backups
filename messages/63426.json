I must admit, I was rather hoping\nthat the Maximals would have been stamped out by now. But pleased to\nsee that they have not been able to stop us either.&quot;  She still stood\nregally before him. &quot;I will tell you this now. I do have personal\nplans of revenge later on. A score to settle with them, if you will.\nBut revenge is a dish best served cold. So I will wait for the proper\ntime. But untill that time comes, I wish to assist you in dealing with\nthis, ah, Unicron situation.&quot;  She smiled at him with a sweet, yet\nslightly evil look. &quot;If this Unicron wins, then we can&#39;t win over the\nMaximals. So, let me know how I can help with this matter.&quot;\n\nShe kept her cool, confident and royal optics on Hydras. If her\nprogams ever evolved into anything, it was never trust another bot. Never.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Airly&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hydras smiled pleased for this bot and quick he calculated her\nwarriors skills\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m pleased that you had a nice travel&quot; said the male while he\nshook her hand &quot;I guess that he had told you our current situation,\nReclusa&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
