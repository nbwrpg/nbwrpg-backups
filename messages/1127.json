Don&#39;t move or she dies.&quot;\n\nSuddenly a blur flies out from the direction of the Ark, smashing\ninto \nZardus and sending him and the blur (Prowl) through several trees and \ninto a boulder. Zardus pulls the trigger on his launcher and it hits \nProwl in the stomach, throwing the maximal to the ground.\n\nZardus growls, discarding the now-empty launcher, stands up, and\nwalks \nover to Prowl, lowering his gun to the maximal&#39;s head.\n\n&quot;How dumb of you. Giving your life for another.&quot; He says, ready to \nblast Prowl&#39;s head to smith\n\n\n"}}
