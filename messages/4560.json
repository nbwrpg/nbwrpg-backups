Vulois quickly responded.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Excellent! Now hurry and bring the driver here. The sooner Hell\n&gt; Beast gets it, the sooner we can go home.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Vulois turns back to Hell Beast.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, sir, will you grant Terminess her lab?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Terminess continued to work dilegently on the Pred base&#39;s auto-guns\n&gt; and shields.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Soon, with a lot more work, the auto-guns will activate as soon as\n&gt; they detect any signature that is not Predacon within a certain\n&gt; distance. They will start firing once the signature gets a bit\n&gt; closer. No more motion detection. To get inside the Pred base, a bot\n&gt; would have to destroy the auto-guns. Hehehehehe!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Terminess continues to mumble to herself as she works on the auto-\n&gt; guns.\n&gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; Octociz s now very scared. No Maximal has seemed to respond to\n&gt; Bronco&#39;s message. Maybe they don&#39;t care about him. Maybe they didn&#39;t\n&gt; get the message. Maybe they have more important things, like an\n&gt; attack. Whatever the case, Octociz sucks up his fear and begins to\n&gt; pray to The Matrix of Leadership. If he is going to die today, he&#39;ll\n&gt; do it with honour, and not like a cowardly little school fem-bot.\n&gt; Bronco looks at him and smiles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;re here. This is a famous spot in Maximal history. See the water\n&gt; down there? Buried beneath there is the remnants of the Axalon. The\n&gt; original base of the Maximals in the Beast Wars. Optimus Primal,\n&gt; Rhinox, Cheetor, Rat Trap, Dino-bot, Tigertron, and Airazor all\n&gt; served here with honour and respect. And in one mega-cycle, you will\n&gt; die with respect. A simple execution, and then you&#39;re body will be\n&gt; dumped into the sea to be buried with the Axalon. A true Maximal\n&gt; death. What&#39;s that? You don&#39;t want to die? We&#39;ll, you had better\n&gt; hurry for your Maximal friends to come save you, and bring me my\n&gt; computer, or it&#39;s all over.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Octociz resumed his praying, hoping, pleading that the Maximals would\n&gt; come in time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Was the salesman clueless?
