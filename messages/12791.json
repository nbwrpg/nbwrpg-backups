There was a vexed glance from him as Sky Knight made his \nrequest to him. Three bots behind him stared back at the monitor at \nhis response. Sky Knight himself, if someone was close to him, they \nwould see him shaking.\n\n&quot;But sir, Beserk can be a used for more better causes.&quot; Sky Knight \nprotested. &quot;The bots who built him were rogues. They used him as a \nweapon against our own people to gain power.&quot;\n\n&quot;Which failed,&quot; the council memeber reminded him.\n\nSky Knight winced. &quot;Yes. Let us prove to you, sir, that Beserk and be \nset right, if programed properly and trained in better situations.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t see the good in this! Beserk is a clone of Megatron! He was \nused to do nothing but terrorize, kill and and sabotage. He killed a \nwhole crew of women, sabotaged two other ships, killed five police \nofficers, attempt to kill us, and threatened a bounty hunter&#39;s life!&quot;\n\n&quot;I know, sir. I understand the irrisponsiblity that those scientists \nportrayed. But we are licensed scientists. Highly skilled, sir. We \nhave constant communications with--&quot;\n\n&quot;Shut up,&quot; the council member barked, and dimmed his optics. He \nappeared to be thinking, then his optics brightened back, glaring \nback onto him. &quot;If you can bring that thing back, I want full reports \neveryday. I want to hear about flaws and deaths. If he kills one bot, \nterminate him once and for all.&quot; \n\nSky Knight froze. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; The monitor went blank. All four \nPredacons slumped their shoulders and sighed in relief in unison. Sky \nKnight turned to his team with a smile. &quot;We did it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do you really think we can bring him back on-line?&quot; the female of \nthe team asked. &quot;After all the damage that bounty hunter did to him?&quot;\n\n&quot;I think so,&quot; Sky Knight replied. &quot;He is after all clasified as a \ndrone.&quot;\n\n&quot;And what about his tendacies to kill?&quot; another asked, the largest \none in the team. &quot;How are we going to break that?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not break it,&quot; Sky Knight replied. &quot;Just control it when he&#39;s around \nus. We need his skills against the Maximals.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;He \nwas well built, all I have to say. Fine armor.&quot; He shook his head \nagain. &quot;He does lack a major function of logic circits. It&#39;s our \ngoal, Predacons to make his clone/drone into a warrior.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s going to be our first job?&quot; the female asked.\n\nSky Knight nodded to her and turned his back to walk. &quot;Follow me, \nI&#39;ll explain it. It&#39;s simple really.&quot; He grinned.\n\n\n"}}
