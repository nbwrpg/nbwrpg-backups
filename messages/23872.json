Her \neyes widened with shock, and she tensed, trying to pull away, but she \nfelt her wounds being healed and she grinned, thankful.\n\nHer artificial muscles knitted back together as the blood replaced \nitself, and her body was as good as new. She put a hand on her arm, \nthe bullet wounds gone.\n\n&quot;Thank you, I&#39;ll have to pay you back sometime&quot; Teltoli smiled at \nAngel Prime.\n\n\n"}}
