Tucson&#39;s brow narrows yet not much on the line of words comes out right=\r\n away.\n\n&quot; Must we always assume the worst Cheetor?  Must we always follow a=\r\n similar path even if it may lead us over a cliff to our demise?  Talon is =\r\nright, Perceptor risked his own life so that we may still remain functionab=\r\nle.  If he were to turn his back on us, he would have done that vorns ago. =\r\n Now, I will not hear another negative word about Perceptor.  Not in my pre=\r\nssence.  He has risked his life for us, and now we must do him the respect =\r\nof showing him our thanks for his efforts.  Now, enough bickering, we have =\r\na tunnel to seal off and Rodimus Prime to bring back online.  I&#39;m sure he w=\r\nouldn&#39;t want to see any of you bickering either.  Am I understood Cheetor?&quot;=\r\n\n\nHis voice as deep as Optimus Prime&#39;s, Tucson Prime speaks his word assert=\r\nively without being aggressive.\n\nQuickstride watches things unfold.\n\n&quot;Wow, =\r\nya know Lord Elder, he may not be able ta see, but he sure knows his words =\r\nof wisdom.
