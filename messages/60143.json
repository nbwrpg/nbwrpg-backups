It pulled up, and \ntransformed.  Its two engine sections straighten out, forming \nfeminine legs ending feet.  It&#39;s feet were that like high heels.  \nThe waist rotated 180 degrees, the two projections off the sides \nracheted forward, the landing claw folding back, hands pushed rom \nthe wrists, forming the arms.  The nose completely detached, the \nsmooth rounde section atache to the left forearm, making a sheild.  \nThe very end of the nose was the sword of this hunter, in its \nightful place, the ight hand.  The head popped from the shoulders \nand spun around.  The optics lit, and Organics decended.\n&gt; &quot;I am Organics.  I am a bounty hunter, I have searche the known \nunivese, and now I have found that which I seek here.

It was really a fighter with a long range booster.  It \n&gt; came online and accessed the booster&#39;s long range sensors.  It \n&gt; detected several things: multiple bases planet side, and the \nlooming \n&gt; Unicron in high orbit.  The craft banke, and made way for the far \n&gt; side of the planet, away from Unicron.  It skimmed across the \n&gt; atmosphere and then entered the atmosphere.  It was going to come \n&gt; down somewhee between all the bases.  After re-entry, the booster \n&gt; section jetisoned and the fighter spread its wings and touched off \n&gt; the engines.  It was then it detected the signal it was looking \n&gt; for.  It was coming fom a base with many Maximal signatures.\n&gt; &gt; &lt;I have found him!
