That&#39;s what Rat Trap&#39;s ph=\r\nilosophy was, until now.  For some really remote reason, he had to go into =\r\nthe dark tower.  Perhaps it was for a scrap of energon that he sensed, or s=\r\nomething even more compelling than that.  In beast form, he could fit anywh=\r\nere that had a small crack or crevace.  There was none to speak of except f=\r\nor a vent hole which he decides is the only way in.  He scrambles inside.\n\n=\r\n&quot;I gotta be crazy, I gotta be outa my processor..  Why of all places would =\r\nI be drawn to a dump like this?&quot;\n\nThe rat thought quietly to himself.  Then=\r\n it hits him.  It wasn&#39;t energon but he had hoped he&#39;d find that too.\n\n&quot;Wai=\r\nt an astro sec...  Energy signatures...  Not Maximal, some preds, some cons=\r\n, but there&#39;s somethn&#39; else here....  Could - could it be? I gotta have a g=\r\nlitch someplace,this can&#39;t be right.&quot;  \n\nHe continues to follow the energy =\r\nsignature.  Of course he was honed in on Nightlights&#39; and not Tucson, who w=\r\nas now off line once again. It compells him although terrified of his surro=\r\nundings, Rat Trap presses on.\n\nHe could sense that trying to make his press=\r\nense known around Nightlight may be dangerous.  He stops to think.\n\n&quot; Hmm, =\r\nif I go directly for that signature I&#39;m a trapped rat.  I better not go tha=\r\nt way right now... But I can feel it, definitely an Autobot signature.&quot;  \n\n=\r\nHe finds himself directly beneath the area where Tucson was being dragged o=\r\nff.  It confirms his findings.\n\n&quot; I was right.  Okay, I can do this, just f=\r\nollow those uglies under ground and hope they don&#39;t see me.  I gotta get wh=\r\neels back online somehow.  This ain&#39;t right, no way I&#39;m gonna watch preds a=\r\nnd cons take advantage of a good bunch of bots.  I gotta be outa my process=\r\nor...&quot;\n\nHe had heard Zarak speak of his battle station and puts two and two=\r\n together.  He waits for a moment, and as Tucson is dragged over the vent s=\r\nhaft, he scrambles quickly and hides within Tucson&#39;s helmet, still in his t=\r\niny beast form and balls up inside hoping not to be caught.  Thoughts racin=\r\ng through his mind..\n\n&quot;This is crazy, this is completely insane, I can&#39;t be=\r\nlieve I&#39;m do&#39;n thiiiis.  But I can&#39;t let those uglies win, I just can&#39;t.  D=\r\non&#39;t worry wheels, I&#39;ll get ya outa this bind, somehow...&quot;\n\nEven though Tuc=\r\nson is off line, Rat Trap could sense something about the Autobot that was =\r\na bit different than the others.  He looks at him, and his physical form.\n\n=\r\n&quot;You sure look familliar...  Wait a sec...  O - Optimus Prime...  Holy serv=\r\no scrap, no wonder why I had this strong urge ta risk my tail end by commn&#39;=\r\n in here..  Ohh boy, I am sooo over my head.&quot;  \n\nHe backs further into Tucs=\r\non&#39;s helmet and tries to remain unseen.  \n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;=\r\nairly2002@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; DarkHawk/Perceptor\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Hydras should be informe=\r\nd about the current situation in Maximal Base&quot;replied the male while he was=\r\n dragging Tucson &quot; and the female shouldl be moved to another place&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nerceptor replied &quot;She wont move to any place and whoever tries to free her =\r\nfor her cell, would be the indirect cause of her death...

With =\r\na tenacity that surprised them, the Autobot filled with the room with smoke=\r\n, using only his tires, the power of his engines and the ambient dust on th=\r\ne floor. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He don&#39;t know when to quit!&quot; Rodimus said as he watched the=\r\n ruckus, trying to target the Autobot through the smoke. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;He is an Au=\r\ntobot.&quot; said Cyclonus as he turned to fire on the fleeing Tuscon\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Scra=\r\np!&quot; Scourge fretted as the smoke interfeared with his sensors. \n&gt; \n&gt; It too=\r\nk a moment for thier optics and sensors to adjust, and by then the Autobot =\r\nwas already on the move. Even as Tuscon ran down on fuel the trio was in pu=\r\nrsuit. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;N - Night - Nightlight.. . Here....&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Tuscon&#39;s eng=\r\nine shuts \n&gt; &gt;&gt;down. Clearly there was not enough energy to make his escape=\r\n, and he had not the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;heart to leave a comrade behind. No matter if it =\r\nwere a Maximal or an Autobot. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;His headlights dim, as his body now goes=\r\n off line due to energy \n&gt; &gt;&gt;exhaustion.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Tuscon ran out of power an=\r\nd came to a stop, a door slid open. &quot;Yes Autobot, she is here, as are other=\r\ns.&quot; said a voice from the shadowed interior of the room, &quot;and now so are yo=\r\nu.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Darkhawk took one of his Feather \n&gt; &gt;missiles and ran towards Tuc=\r\nson and he Used a stunned gun againts Him, then \n&gt; &gt;manually starting to tr=\r\nansformn Him to his Robot mode and once he was in \n&gt; &gt;his robot mode he tie=\r\nd him thignly. \n&gt; \n&gt; As Darkhawk finished his work, a figure moved from the=\r\n room, the ambient light finally piercing the shadows as it stepped into th=\r\ne hall to reveal the form of the head master unit called Zarak.\n&gt; \n&gt; He cas=\r\nually stepped forward and leaned over the depowered and now stunned form of=\r\n Tuscon, &quot;We have use for one like you.&quot; He ran a scanner over Tuscon&#39;s fra=\r\nme &quot;Yes, one so like the old Prime.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You see it don&#39;t you Autobot?&quot; Z=\r\narak said, speaking to the inert form of Tuscon. &quot;Our scanners also reveale=\r\nd something else.&quot; Zarak straightened as he changed the feed of his scanner=\r\n to link with the base scanners, &quot;There is a minion floating over the old M=\r\naximal base, quite possibly attacking it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zarak chuckled, &quot;With it th=\r\nere, all your Autobot and Maximal friends are no doubt rushing to get there=\r\n to defend that pitiful piece of technology, possibly even some of the ones=\r\n defending the ark.&quot; Zarak&#39;s optics widened in mock surprise, &quot;I&#39;m surprise=\r\nd you didn&#39;t get the call.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Zarak smiled again, mockingly, derisively,=\r\n &quot;And now we have you, so much like the old Prime and we have a lightly def=\r\nended Ark and a Matrix waiting for us to plunder.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;MWHAHAHAHAaaa!&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;Yes, we have a use for him.&quot; Zarak said as he turned to look at Darkhaw=\r\nk, &quot;Bring him to my battle station, we have a treasure that awaits us!&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; OOC: I am assuming that Tuscon is indeed knocked out. Please keep in mind=\r\n Zarak is scanning Tuscon quite carefully, so playing possum will be diffic=\r\nult. \n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt; (Cyclonus/Scourge/Rodimus/Zarak)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
