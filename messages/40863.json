And remember the beast wars \ncybertronians come from millions of years in the future after the \ngreat war(I think... been a while since I watched BW, but a million \nor so years sounds good), so their technology has had to become more \nadvanced. And also note the Infecticons come from another timeline \nand farther in the future then the BW tfs.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., robertdahl &lt;rdahl@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Just thought I would add my two cents. I do agree that missiles\n&gt; shouldnt be fired, but they do have a much more advanced technology \nthan\n&gt; we do, so we dont know for sure. I do know that a transformers body \nis\n&gt; able to stabalize pressures, as they were doing it in a comic book\n&gt; issue, but it is very energy costly, and as soon as their energy \nruns\n&gt; out, they would begin to get crushed. That isnt the end all of the\n&gt; discussion, just what I thought. Remember, the Autobots and \nDecepticons\n&gt; were blasting missiles at each other underwater in two different\n&gt; episodes (Atlantis Arise, The Ultimate Doom part 1), suggesting that\n&gt; maybe their artilary can stand up to pressures.\n\n\n"}}
