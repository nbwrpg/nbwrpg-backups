How she would gladly let her spark return to the Matrix for a\nmoment longer of his love for her. She let her arms tighten around him\nas she never wanted to let go. She knew she loved him and would die\nfor him at a moment&#39;s notice. Then a small program cycled in the back\nof her mind.  She loved him wnough to not make him choose. She knew he\nwas her spark-mate. But her love for him went beyond herself. More\nthan her own happiness, she wanted him to be happy.  She knew she\ncould make him feel on top of the universe.  But to ask him to tear\nhis spark into pieces just to make a choice was more torture than her\nspark could bare.  She shoved this thought process into the back of\nher mind and just savored what she thought was her last bit of\nhappiness with him.  She felt her face plates flush a bit as a soft\nmoan escaped from her.  She couldn&#39;t help it. She loved him and wanted\nhim so much. So badly she needed him. A war had started in her, not a\nwar for life or territory, not for factions or bases. But the hardest\nwar of all, to make a choise for love. She wished that once this\nmoment had passes her spark would stop for she didn&#39;t want to live\npast this moment. \nShe sighed and melted into his arms even further. Without realizing\nit, a soft whisper escaped her lips, &quot;I Love You.&quot; and kissed him even\nharder. \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Malice:\n&gt;  \n&gt; He felt the old twisting anger rise up in him once again.  He had\nbeen doing so well keeping it supressed the last few days, since\nmeeting Wolfblade then Blacknightmare.  But it felt like the burning\nrage was returning, and didn&#39;t know when he&#39;d be able to calm down. \nBut thankfully it suddenly melted away when she suprised him with a\npassionate kiss.  At first total suprise kept him from doing anything,\nbut he melted into the kiss and reciprocated, letting his love for her\nflow through him to her.  he held her closer, not willing to part with\nher for anything else in the world.  He&#39;d have his spark ripped out of\nhis chest before then.  He made a realization, one that would change\ntheir lives forever, but did not break the moment of passion, feeling\nthe need to continue it until he no longer could.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
