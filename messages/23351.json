She wasn&#39;t used to \nbeing caught by suprise, usually she can sence the emotions of others before \nthey have reached her or Snow Tech. she unconciously rasied her arm to \nprotect herself, sheil extending from it&#39;s energy form.*\n\n&quot; What the Inferno.... Who are you?&quot;\n\n* She keeps her shield raised and places her hand next to her lightning \nblaster for a quick retrival if he was an enemy. Mabey her internals where \nbusted up, she needed to find out why she could not sence his arrival.*\n\n*Snow Tech glances at the barrel of Prowls gun, a half smirk on his face. He \nturns his head to IR and speaks out of the side of his mouth so only she \ncould hear*\n\n&quot; My, your tastes have changed since last we talked, now you go for \nover-protective and ugly? Jeeze, i thought i taught you better than that!&quot;\n\n* He looks back at Prowl, knowing that if he said anything wrong, this new \nbot would kill him, and probally blow of Ir&#39;s arm. And Snow Tech was too \ngood of a friend to let that happen. He touched Iron Raptors shoulder and \nspoke gentley and firmly to him,*\n\n&quot; Iron and I are good friends, if you must know, and I was just jocking, you \nmoron, if you hadn&#39;t noticed. And, if you do not lower that gun from my \nface, we will not get along. Plus, if you shoot me, you have a chance of \nhitting Iron. And then i don&#39;t think she will love you much then, now will \nshe?&quot;\n\n* Snow Tech had taken his hand from Iron Raptors shoulder and placed it on \nhis Ice-beam shooter, magnetically un snapping it from it&#39;s fastening and \nplacing it into his hands, just in case this bot was a nut case and would \nshoot him. He also put his energy sheild on hold so in a nano, it would \nactivate and save him and Iron from major damage.*\n\n&quot; So, just chill dude,&quot;\n\n* He placed his arm with his sheild on it in front of Iron Raptor, his first \nconcern. Snow Tech did not know what new weapons Iron had now, but he wasn&#39;t \ntaking any chances.*\n\n&quot; And put DOWN your weapon!&quot;\n\n* Snow Techs last request sounded with athourity, rarely heard through his \njuviniell lips, but when sounded, he made shure they new he ment buissness.*\n\n\n\n* The little &#39;un was watching all this from the top of Prowls head. \nConfused, he watched the bot he had choosen to inspect aim a weapon at his \nfriends who had saved him from harm a while back. His hackeles began to \nraise and his claws dug into the bots head. Before Snow tech could say no, \nhe placed himself on top of Prowls eyes, effectivally blinding him, and \nbegan to attak with little sharp claws, prowls top lip.*\n\n&quot; Mew, Fhtttt!&quot;\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
