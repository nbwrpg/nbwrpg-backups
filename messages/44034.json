By the way I would do this in polls but\n&gt; no one&#39;s answering \n&gt; &gt; mine anymore and I want comments about your\n&gt; opinions. Would you be \n&gt; &gt; willing to have a char in a faction made entirely\n&gt; of proto-humans \n&gt; &gt; trying to banish the &quot;demons&quot; from their planets,\n&gt; and should they be \n&gt; &gt; allowed to use magic and energon spear and\n&gt; hammerheads to even the \n&gt; &gt; odds. If I get 3 supporting replies and no\n&gt; negative ones I&#39;ll do it \n&gt; &gt; (forget it Nemisis you don&#39;t count).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A shuttle is crashing to earth.
