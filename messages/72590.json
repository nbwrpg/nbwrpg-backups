One wrong move could possibly cripple him if h=\r\ne were to\n&gt; fracture a limb as was the case for equine animals.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; I dun=\r\nno about this.  I better continue in robot mode.  One wrong move and\n&gt; it&#39;s=\r\n curtains for me.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a look from SANTON as, while in his la=\r\nrge mammoth mode,\npeered over at QUICKSTRIDE with one of his large eyes. &quot;I=\r\n am sure that\nyou are made of sterner stuff than that.&quot; He said gently. &quot;Af=\r\nter all,\nsome of us my look like animals on the outside, but in the inside =\r\nwe\nare still Cybertronians through and through.&quot;\n\nUsing his rather large tr=\r\nunk he brushed aside some debris as they\nwalked, his heavily armored form l=\r\numbering along.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; His passengers dismount as he shifts into robo=\r\nt mode.  Rattrap and Straight\n&gt; Shot appear to be comfortable with the deci=\r\nsion and carry on normally.\n&gt; Their short stubby legs prove useful over den=\r\nse vegetation and fallen tree\n&gt; stumps.  Straight Shot stops for a moment a=\r\nnd sniffs the area.  Rattrap does\n&gt; the same. The rodent duo quickly catch =\r\na scent, and stay on it intensely.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Guys, over here, I just caught ont=\r\no my brother&#39;s scent.  Battery fluid..\n&gt; Oh no, he&#39;s bleeding.  I hope it&#39;s=\r\n not serious.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap pulls out a silver metallic scale from the groun=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ditto, but I dunno, look what I just found.  This has some serious=\r\n damage\n&gt; on it, looks like it got ripped off the big guy as if he was figh=\r\nt&#39;n\n&gt; someone.   HEY!   LOOK!  I WAS RIGHT!  THERE WAS A BAAAAD BATTLE HERE=\r\n ALL\n&gt; RIGHT!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride rushes over and inspects the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Y=\r\nep, confrontation confirmed, Sir!  Look at the ground, debris is kicked\n&gt; u=\r\np all over the place, Rattrap found one of Tucson Prime&#39;s scales, mangled,\n=\r\n&gt; and there&#39;s a bit of battery fluid on the ground.  Yikes what the pit did=\r\n he\n&gt; run into?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot looks at the prints on the ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;=\r\n It&#39;s not a matter of what, it&#39;s a matter of who.  I know these tracks,\n&gt; b=\r\nesides my brothers these other tracks here, they look like Grimlock&#39;s.  But=\r\n\n&gt; why would he attack his own comrades?  I don&#39;t get it.  Tucson used to w=\r\nork\n&gt; with him vorns ago, and they seemed to work well together.  I know Tu=\r\ncson\n&gt; never do anything ta hurt his feelings, because he stood up for Grim=\r\nlock on\n&gt; occasion.  This isn&#39;t right at all.&quot;\n\n &lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThere was a pause f=\r\nrom SANTON as he looked over at STRAIGHT SHOT,\n&quot;Grimlock and his entire tea=\r\nm went missing a short while after the Pax\nCybertronia was signed.&quot; He said=\r\n calmly as he walked along. &quot;And from\nwhat I gather Tuscon was manufactured=\r\n sometime after that was sign and\npeace declared.&quot;\n\nSANTON turned to look a=\r\nt the area as he shifted into robot mode, the\nevidence of a battle was clea=\r\nr for all to see. &quot;I don&#39;t think Grimlock\nwas working well with anyone at t=\r\nhat time.&quot; There was a look of\nremorse that went over SANTON&#39;s face for a m=\r\noment.\n\nLEO PRIME transformed into robot mode as he looked around the area.=\r\n\n&quot;There has been a battle.&quot; He looked up into the tree line and then\nback a=\r\nt the ground and then squated to examine the ground as well. &quot;I\nsee evidenc=\r\ne of Grimlock, Snarl, Slag and Sludge.&quot; Evidently either\nLEO had worked wit=\r\nh the DINOBOTS or had been trained to know them by\ntheir tracks.\n\nThere was=\r\n a nod from BANTOR as he too looked over the area, &quot;I can see\nthe same trac=\r\nks.=94 He said as he squatted next to LEO PRIME, both of\nthem looking like =\r\nexpert hunters on some animal=92s trail.\n\nBANTOR looked at some of the othe=\r\nr tracks, using his clawed hand to\nexamine them closely. =93But there are o=\r\nther tracks here that I do not\nrecognize.&quot; He pointed off a direction into =\r\njungle where a faint trail\ncan be seen. &quot;They appear to have taken Tuscon i=\r\nn that direction.&quot;\n\nLEO looked down at his makeshift homing beacon that HYD=\r\nRAS had given\nhim, &quot;That is in the direction this device indicates that we =\r\nneed to\ngo.&quot;\n\nThere was a nod from TERRORGATOR, one of the PREDACON FUZORS =\r\nwalked\nover, another who seemed quite at home in the rain forest and jungle=\r\ns.\n=93But that is not the only ones who have been here.=94 He gestured down=\r\n\nat other tracks. =93A group . . . two have been here and left. They went\nt=\r\nhat way.=94 He pointed in another direction entirely.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
