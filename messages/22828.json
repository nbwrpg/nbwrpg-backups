She was going to \nfind it hard not to walk up to her old friends and not tell them who \nshe was.  She sighed and closed her mind.  She didn&#39;t want Razor Claw \nor Lunarpine to know what she was thinking or feeling. She had to be \nstrong and be a leader.  This was something new for her and she was \ntrying hard to conceal her fear, which was rising in her throat.\n\nShe took the pod down to the open area just outside the base.  She \nlooked out the windows and waited for the sign that they could enter \nthe base.  She turned to Razor Claw. &quot;Your signature isn&#39;t maximal, \nbutit&#39;s not pred either.  Watch what you say.  Remember, these were \nfriends of mine from a long time ago. So they can be trusted. Just \ndon&#39;t tell them who I am or who you are. You are Razor Claw, my third \nin command and chief security officer. Or would you like another \ntitle?  One that sounds more impressive maybe?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
