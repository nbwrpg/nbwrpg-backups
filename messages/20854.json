He slides off as she comes to a stop, setting Iris on \nthe ground, concerned about whether Iron Raptor&#39;s leg was allright.\n\n&quot;Are you allright, love?&quot; he asks, putting a hand on her, behind her \nshoulder, and looking at it in concern.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptors shoulder jerked but absoebed the impact the best way \nit knew \n&gt; how as her front limb came down hard onto a rock which slipped out \nfrom \n&gt; under her.\n&gt; Almost falling she decides to slow down to a small jog, wondering \nif they \n&gt; were closer to the area which Iris had selected for this merge she \nkept \n&gt; talking about.\n&gt; She heard the programs annoyed yip.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Watch what you&#39;re going! Do you want him to drop me?!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor sighed as she looked back over her shoulder.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s beginning to look like a fairly attractive action right \nabout \n&gt; now....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she simply turned back around, taking what comfort \nshe could \n&gt; at the feeling of Prowl relaxing on her back as he was.\n&gt; \n&gt; The area around them seemed to open up into a wide plain, seeing \nsmall herds \n&gt; of grass grazing animals off in the distance, slightly wondering if \nthis was \n&gt; the right place in which Iris wanted to stop.\n&gt; And her question was comfirmed.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS:&quot; Stop! We&#39;re here. You ready, Birdman?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor came to a stop and rolled her shoulder in its socket, \ngrinding \n&gt; her teeth at the aching pain she felt in the joint.\n&gt; She shook herself hard, even though Prowl was still on her back \nholding \n&gt; Iris.\n&gt; She just didn&#39;t like the feeling of someone on her back.\n&gt; How horses stood it during the time of humans was completely beyond \nher.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Is it a good idea to do this with both of us injured? Couldn&#39;t it \ncause \n&gt; problems?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
