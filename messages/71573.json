As far as anyone could see there were dead\ndinosaurs of all sorts.\n\nMercifully the sun was beginning to set around them, which of course\nmeant that the nighttime scavengers were beginning to make themselves\nheard as well as the sounds of ancient breeds of canines could be\nheard howling in the distance as and glowing eyes could be seen even\ncloser.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
