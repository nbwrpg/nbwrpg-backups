How could this onw be from before the Cybertron\nRevolutionary war(Or First Cybertronian war.)? Those were the times\nbefore Cybertrons became Transformers. Back in the time of Alpha\nTrion(Or A3 as he was known then.) And Predicons in the second Great\nWar? He only knew of the Decepticon gestalt group known as Predicons.\n\nHis kick made contacct with Unitron&#39;s block. He pushed off, back\nflipping to his feet. He then ducked, and sent a punch for Unitron&#39;s mid\nsection.\n\n"}}
