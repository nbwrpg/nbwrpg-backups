I found myself burried upside-down in the sand, with no\nrecollection of how I got there.  Before that I had been assisting a\nfew bots on another crashed ship with repairs, but I have no idea\nwhere that was, how far away or whether they are still there or not.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not that I had any special attachment to that group either, I\njust sumbled upon that ship the same way I found this one.  I am not\ncertain, but these memory losses may be happening more often than I\ncare to admit....&quot;\n\nCeleron felt more at ease with sharing this now there was only one\nother bot onboard.\n\n&quot;Do you have any diagnostic equipment onboard?  I have not had a full\nrepair and diagnosis for a very long time...&quot;\n\n\nOn Tue, 7 Dec 2004 22:26:37 -0800 (PST), robert riley\n&lt;bustercross365@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellplague:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;About 70 megacycles, you were busy the entire time.
