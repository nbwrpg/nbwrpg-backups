He bears the pain and allows his body to be\n&gt; manipulated back as wheels give way to arms, legs, hands and feet.  Slowly\n&gt; he comes back to robotic form.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Ughh, okay, I&#39;m there, stop pull&#39;n .  Thanks for the hand, I needed that.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\n&quot;Can you walk?&quot; WOLFGANG said to NIGHTSHIFT as he tried to help him\nup. &quot;We need to get you to the CR chamber, and see if we can get you\nfixed up.&quot;\n\nThere was an explosion that rocked the shuttle.\n\n&quot;Whatever you care going to do, get him there quickly! This ride is\ngoing to get awefully bumpy!&quot; The voice was POLAR CLAW&#39;s and he was\nsitting in the front sit, his body covered in long scratch marks and\nwounds and part of his chest has been singed by some sort of flame.\n\nOutside the SWOOP flew past the window of the shuttle as he came\naround for another attack, he was obviously far more agile then the\nshuttle and about as well armed.\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
