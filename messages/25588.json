I was told that the Alliance had started fighting on Angel Prime and \nstuff like that.\nForget my last post with IR in it. I misunderstood a few posts. I guess \nthat&#39;s what happens when you start posting when you&#39;re board out of your \ntree.\nPlus I didn&#39;t know that FZ was having other nagotiation with other bots.\nThis is a better post so just emit the last one.\n\n* Iron Raptor glared out towards the battlefield, her sword in hand a ready \nfor trouble.\nShe knew for a fact that FZ wouldn&#39;t let any of the Alliance release \nChordate and that this was a slight waste of time. All they were doing now \nwas running their collective mouths and trying to make themselves sound more \nintimidating then the other.\nBut she knew that the Alliance had the upper hand and the CF was getting \ncloser and closer to simply falling apart just like the Ark had before it \nwas repaired and sent into space. That was the last she had heard of it.\nIron Raptor sighed and leaned her weight on one leg, keeping her eyes on the \nbattle and watching over everything that was done.\nThere was nothing she could do for Angel Prime, he had dug his own hole and \nhe was adult enough to get himself out of it. She had given him the chance \nand he had ignored it. Even though she hated to admit it, she wasn&#39;t going \nto help him.\nBesides, it wasn&#39;t fair to the other Maximals to just order them to go out \nthere and risk getting their brains blown out just to save a bot who \ncouldn&#39;t save himself. But this wasn&#39;t only her call.\nSome of the Maximals behind her might be itching to fight while others were \npraying that the Alliance would just leave.\nIron Raptor looked towards Prowl for a moment before glancing over her \nshoulder towards the remainder of the Maximals.\nThere was nagotiations going on right now so attack was not an option, but \nsimply standing here and doing nothing could get to a lot of Maximals that \nhad been in a battle rage only moments before. But they would have to hold \nup. Just like her. &lt; We wait.&gt; she thought to Prowl. &lt; See just what they&#39;re \nup to, then maybe make our way to the CF to either get the captives or try \nand repair some of the weapons so we stand more of a chance.&gt;* Iron Raptor \ncentered her stance.*\n\n&quot; We wait.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
