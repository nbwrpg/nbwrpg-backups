But when I had a little more \ntime and could, =\r\nI always come back to the RPs. My focus is upon the \nstory and the regular =\r\ninteraction with other players. I&#39;m telling a \nstory not just for my own fu=\r\nn and benefit, but for those out there \nwho may be lurking and reading thes=\r\nes stories. And believe me, people \nDO come and glance at these. I&#39;ve had a=\r\n fan base in the past from \nsome of my role playing stories. Those stories =\r\nonly fail or end when \nother players do NOT remain involved. \n\nGet involved=\r\n people! If you join ANY Role Playing game or story, you \nMUST realize that=\r\n you should make that commitment to role play often. \nTake that time. Trust=\r\n me, it&#39;s not that hard to do so. Otherwise, if \nno rules or guidelines hav=\r\ne been laid down how often you should play, \nthen state how often you can p=\r\nlay OOC in the list or forum you are \ninvolved in. Get to know the story an=\r\nd how fast that pace is. \nEspecially when you are interacting with other pe=\r\nople... those people \nwait on you. Some RPs I&#39;ve been in in the past... peo=\r\nple will \ncontinue to post and leave you behind if you can&#39;t keep up with a=\r\n \nstory. But your lack of commitment to something you joined is not the \nfa=\r\nult of others. \n\nPerhaps this is rude of me... but I&#39;ve been doing this a l=\r\nong, long \ntime.. these online role playing stories. I&#39;m only passing along=\r\n to \nyou what was said to me and what has happened to me. It can be \nfrustr=\r\nating and turns people off when you are left behind. But there \nis a differ=\r\nence in how you are left behind. Don&#39;t be left behind at \nyour own fault ca=\r\nuse you refuse to take the time to post. Remember... \nyou are affecting som=\r\neone else. Another player&#39;s character is held up \nby you and they can&#39;t do =\r\nanything until you post something, whether \nIC or OOC. \n\nYou join, be commi=\r\ntted. And use communication! \n\n\n\n~Lady B\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;xochitla2006&quot; &lt;xochitla2006@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok after meditating a while=\r\n our fellow living, I felt some how \nguilty \n&gt; of that happened. I admit th=\r\ne part that I have with and I feel that \nI \n&gt; have to care more of this RPG=\r\n. In order to improve our situation \n&gt; here, I have follow suggestion in or=\r\nder to keep things running:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. If a player is waitting an answer for a=\r\nnother player and that \n&gt; answer didnt come, I strongly suggest that you ch=\r\nar focus in \nanother \n&gt; player.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In case that your char is stuck in =\r\na situation, move him/her in \n&gt; order to you can interac with actives or mo=\r\nre receptives players.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also Stac suggest follow:\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. If somoene=\r\n is going to be involved, they need to make that \n&gt; commitment to post on a=\r\n regular basis. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4.  Players at least are active and post at least onc=\r\ne a day to \nkeep \n&gt; the story moving and not leave other players who are in=\r\nvolved in \nthe \n&gt; dark and in hiatus... \n&gt; \n&gt; I Know that above is not alwa=\r\nys posible, but I suggest that you try \n&gt; to post at least once x day or no=\r\nt be so absent for so long.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; As Stac says &quot;When I get involved, I ge=\r\nt involved&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I also  want to admit that I dont get so involved late=\r\nly and I want \n&gt; to be the first one to be involved again in this RPG. Who =\r\nis with \nme? \n&gt; Who has a comment?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
