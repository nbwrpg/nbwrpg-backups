What was the name of that cool robot who \nworked for the Toadies?)\n\nShockwave/Unitron:\n\n\n\n&quot;All are inferior to Decepticons.  They cannot defeat eons of experience.&quot;\n\nAfter Shockwave stated that simple fact loud enough for anyone to hear, the \nspace fighter that was his current mode did some sharp maneuvers, avoiding \nthe missiles, but three of Hot Rod&#39;s lasers dug into his left wing, not \npiercing it though.  He returned fire wtih two missiles, splitting apart, one \nheading for Windlord and the other for Train Wreck.\n\n---\n\nUnitron avoided the missiles relatively easily, some shrapnel digging into \nhis back fins but it wasn&#39;t to bad.  He was able to easily avoid the incoming \nrobot, Aerotaur, but two of the robot&#39;s lasers struck his space fighter form \nin the side, barely missing some vital parts.\n\n&quot;Maximal filth.&quot; he cursed, firing off fifteen rapid lasers at Hot Rod and \nmaking a u-turn in the air that put some pressure on his engines, launching \noff a missile at Aerotaur as he adjusted his course so he was no longer \nflying towards him.\n\n&quot;Shall I call the Ramora for aid?&quot; Unitron asked via comm. with Shockwave.\n\n&quot;Unneccessary.  We shall contact Firestarter only when he is needed.&quot;\n\n"}}
