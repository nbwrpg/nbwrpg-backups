You need to fear nothing from me. Perhaps I \ncan help you find out who you are. I have some kind of talents that i \ncould use. I can dive and help your spark find its way. Even if it \nturns out you are a Predacon, I will not hurt you nor will I try to \nmodify your spark. I have sworn it and I still intend to uphold my \nword. But if you prefer to find another, I can help you find one.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., HanaKirei85@a... wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; AzureBlade displayed some sort of friendly smile. Of course, \nbeing \n&gt; &gt; totally transmetal did not help the motion, but he managed it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; AzureBlade: We are on prehistoric Earth. There is a war going on, \nand \n&gt; &gt; there is a battle not far from here. You can check your sensors \nfor \n&gt; &gt; confirmation. I, however, am not implicated in this battle. I came \n&gt; &gt; here directly for you. I felt your spark and...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suddenly he was out of words. How should he say this? Of course, \nhe \n&gt; &gt; was a warrior, tall, strong and proud. How could he say anything \n&gt; &gt; without making her go crazy at him? This was the first time it \n&gt; &gt; happened to him.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Prehistoric Earth...was that where she was? And a war as well...that \nmeant \n&gt; there were more on this planet. In a way, she was glad...but in a \nway, she \n&gt; had almost hoped not to discover such a thing. Was she to have to \nfight as \n&gt; well? Without knowing what side she was on? Who her allies were? And \nher \n&gt; enemies...what if AzureBlade turned out to be...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I see..&quot; she said quietly. At least she had nothing to fear from \nhim yet. \n&gt; Unless it turned out he was, she wouldn&#39;t consider him a threat..he \ndidn&#39;t \n&gt; seem to pose her any, as he&#39;d said. She smiled slightly &quot;Thank you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;AzureBlade: The fact is I am a Maximal, and, if you would like, \nyou \n&gt; &gt; can join my faction. By the way, what is your faction?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; That was a question she had been somewhat dreading. &quot;My faction? \n&gt; Well..I...I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Her ears flickered, annoyed at herself once \nagain \n&gt; &quot;My memory was partially damaged somehow...I don&#39;t remember.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
