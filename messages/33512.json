I only picked him cause I thought he was the odd man out\n&gt;:) I always heard it was Skywarp, because he was more popular.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Megatron still was paying more attention to the battle than the events\n&gt;unfolding below him. He then swiftly lifted off the ground, and landed\n&gt;beside Fireblade. &quot;It dosent matter if I am the real Megatron or not.\n&gt;I won their loyalty by my actions not my legacy,&quot; Megatron countered.\n&gt;&quot;But you are not the enemy&quot; He said refering to Ultra Megatron, &quot;And\n&gt;we are in the middle of a war,&quot; He motioned his arms for the\n&gt;Decepticons to lower their arms.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
