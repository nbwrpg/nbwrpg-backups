LEO turned\nto look at him as well a curious look on his face.\n\nLEGACY&#39;s cyclopean optic glowed thoughtfully. &quot;We have determined from\nthe reports that the jungle area seems to inhibit standard RF\ntransmissions, which include transmissions, video signals and the\nlike.&quot; He turned to look at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;IFF signatures are based\nprimarilly two things, sensory recognition, such as what someone looks\nlike, sounds like and apears as.&quot; He paused again to make sure that\neveryone was keeping up with him. &quot;The other side the reading of IFF\nsignatures is a short range radio transmission which basically\ntransmits simlar information like faction and name.&quot;\n\nLEGACY turned to regard LORD ELDER and LEO PRIME, &quot;That is why it is\nsimple enough to create a spark claoking device, you are simply\ncloaking or masking that signature that is being sent. Since the\njungle is inhibiting RF transmission already that means that there\nshould be no way for them to read the secondary part of the IFF\nsignature and since Straight Shot would look different, she is free to\nreinvent herself within the confines of the jungle.&quot;\n\nHe turned to look back at STRAIGHT SHOT. &quot;So long as there is no one\nthat knows you in there.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
