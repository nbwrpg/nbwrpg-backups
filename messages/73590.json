You think I would waste my time\nplaying tricks on you?&quot; She seemed genuinely frustrated, and angry and\nanxious.\n\nShe reached into a section of armor, which caused the TERRORCONS to\nraise their weapons menacingly at ANTAGONY.\n\n&quot;Keep your armor on&quot; The ebony colored ant said fiercely. &quot;I just\nwanted to show you something.&quot; ANTAGONY held out a locator device and\nthen threw it to CRYOTEK. &quot;Go check it out for yourself.&quot;\n\nCRYOTEK caught it smoothly and looked at it.\n\n&quot;It could be a trap.&quot; HUN-GRRR said as he glanced over at CRYOTEK.\n\nHe shook his head, &quot;No, I believe her.&quot; CRYOTEK said easily.
