One \nwho is part snake and part scorpion.  She looks at and thinks it&#39;s \ndead.  She keeps walking and finds a huge spider who fires on her. \nShe is hit and falls.  She then sees herself flying over the \nlandscape.  She flies over a ship.  It was heavily damaged and had \nhuge gaping holes in the sides.  She keeps flying and passes \nmountains, rivers, lush green valleys.  Then all is dark.  She enters \ndreamless sleep.\n\n\n"}}
