He glanced at \nSpears, \n&gt; wondering who she could have named. She hadn&#39;t been on the planet \nfor \n&gt; too long, so she probably didn&#39;t know who was the Maximal leader, \nbut \n&gt; he was sure he had met at least a few high officials.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing was for sure in Striker&#39;s mind, whoever the Maximal \nleader \n&gt; was would probably be this team&#39;s next target. He couldn&#39;t let that \n&gt; happen. Setting his scanners to give him info on the chip in \nSpears&#39; \n&gt; head, Striker looks back at Prebon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who should he name? Someone that Spears might have also named, \n&gt; someone who was experienced, someone like.....\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ramulus,&quot; Striker says, &quot;And if you let Spears and me go, I can \nlead \n&gt; you right to him. Or him to you, whichever you preffer.&quot;\n&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; Ramulus lets out a breath of relief as the shuttle lands safely, \n&gt; nearly jumping out of his seat as the belt releases. He makes his \nway \n&gt; outside, looking lovingly around at nature, even if nature was a \nbit \n&gt; charred and cratered. This is where he belonged, not on some moon.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks back at the Maximals, waiting for them to say something.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
