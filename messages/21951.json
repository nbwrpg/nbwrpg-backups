She didn&#39;t want to hear another word from the \nannoying snake.\n&gt; Even though he did claim to have royal blood and did seem to have \nsome need\n&gt; for them to act like a married couple.\n&gt; \n&gt; The shuttle shook as it landed. &quot;Thank the Avatars of the wind.&quot; \n(Her form\n&gt; of religion) She was glad to have finally landed. Now maybe she \ncould\n&gt; finally be rid of this annoying creature. &quot;Now can He let go?&quot; she \nasked ouy\n&gt; of annoyance. A snake that large was cramping her wrapped arm and \nwings. She\n&gt; wanted to return to robot mode and a more dignified form.(She&#39;s \nbeen stuck\n&gt; in half hawk mode since the battle at the old base.) She used her \nmiddle eye\n&gt; to scan the surroundings. She was sure precautions would be taken \nso she&#39;d\n&gt; wait for a more opportune moment to escape. Or maybe Zardus would \naccept her\n&gt; mistake and let her continue her work. It benefitted the alliance \nto much to\n&gt; be left alone and Squizzy didn&#39;t know enough to continue.\n&gt; \n&gt; Najah opened his big mouth once more questioning her intelligence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lady Hawk looked straight at Zardus, he was getting cocky. He \ndidn&#39;t think\n&gt; she could do any damage while she was wrapped up. He was wrong. If \nshe were\n&gt; to open her mouth and shriek right now the Alliance would be \nlooking for a\n&gt; new leader. Unfortunately that also meant that Veratis would be \nlooking for\n&gt; a new daughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What exactly is it you&#39;d like to know?&quot; she asked knowing he heald \nall the\n&gt; cards.
