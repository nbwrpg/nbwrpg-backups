It was not so much \nthat \n&gt; he was damaged, but that the pain was overwhelming.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his dreams, however, he saw.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had always been closer to his Maximal side. No one could have \nmade \n&gt; him doubt that. Perhaps it was because the Maximals had always \nbeen \n&gt; there for him, or that the Predacons he had met were always \n&gt; criminals... One thing was certain, he was almost a true Maximal \nat \n&gt; spark.\n&gt; \n&gt; Almost.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, what he was seeing was his spark, bright blue, darken, more \nand \n&gt; more, until it was a deep navy blue. He heard himself scream, but \nhe \n&gt; was not sure if it was out of pain, fear, or anger. He simply \n&gt; screamed.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; WindlorD:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ahh Denzabar... do you see that machine&quot;said Winlord qhile he \n&gt; &gt; looked a movile scanner &quot;Give it you Kup...
