He falls to one knee and then to the other.  The battery fluid\nloss had indeed taken him.\n\nQuickstride and Uproar are quick to try and catch him.\n\n&quot;Woahh, Rodimus and Legacy have a point Sir.  It&#39;s time you took care of\nyour own needs.&quot;\n\nReplies Quickstride as he and Uproar now help him to his feet.  Tucson still\nhad that apprehension.  Although he needed help, he still felt that the\nneeds of his comrades had to come first.\n\n&quot; My - own needs - can wait.  The - others need help more than I do.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot could see what was happening.\n\n&quot;Stubborn as usual.  C&#39;mon Tucson, Rodimus and Legacy are right, you need ta\ntake care of yourself! I know what happened in the past was hard for you ta\ntake, but that wasn&#39;t your fault!  You got struck from behind by Cyclonus,\nand there was no way of predicting that!&quot;\n\nTucson sighs.\n\n&quot;I - could have prevented it though.  And I - can&#39;t - let it happen again.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot could see that Tucson did need help urgently.\n\n&quot;Legacy, please get Tucson ta the CR Chambers ASAP.  And make sure he\nactually takes your advice.&quot;\n\nTucson couldn&#39;t say anything else.  He knew his little sister was right.\n\nStraight Shot looks to Rodimus now knowing why Tucson was acting as he was.\nIt wasn&#39;t out of revenge, it was out of compassion, and guilt.  But a guilt\nhe did not deserve to carry.\n\n&quot; He feels really bad about what happened..  He thinks that your\ndisappearence and abduction was his fault.  In all truths it was no one&#39;s\nfault but Hydras&#39;s.  Before he became a Prime, he really took his job\nseriously and still does but back then, for an Autobot, he was all\ndedication and didn&#39;t care what kind of consequences he&#39;d face while going\nabove and beyond the call of duty.  All he cares about is his comrades, and\neven back then, his loyalty was soley for you and the others.  He was always\nso proud to be working with you, and would do anything to uphold the level\nof heroism that&#39;s always expected of Autobot and Maximal kind.  Then, that\nday, the time you were taken from us..  That was the day he was trying to\ndivert enemy attentions away from you by doing what was highly\nuncharacteristic of himself.  Decoy work was always deemed for those who\nwere natural built speedsters, but he&#39;s no speedster.  When he chose his\nform, he chose the working class vehicle, which is known more for strength\nand durability than speed. But out of desperation to try and save you, he\ndid what he normally didn&#39;t do, and then, that&#39;s when he got shot by\nCyclonus. It took him off line instantly.  He doesn&#39;t remember anything\nafter that.  I was taken off line at the same time, but, I did stay\nconscious enough to see the blast. Shortly after he went off line, I did.\nBut strange, I remember more than he does.  And that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting as he\nis.  He&#39;s trying to sorta make up for lost time.&quot;\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He turns to Rodimus.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Inform Ramulus to prepare the med bay for me. It&#39;s about time I\n&gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; put to work some of the skills I&#39;ve aquired from Ratchet and Wheeljack.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Straight Shot looks to Tucson.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; You really should have an assistant.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes. Legacy, if you could, I&#39;d like you to assist me.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus looked at Tuscon strangely. &quot;Tuscon!&quot; Rodimus&#39; voice had a\n&gt; surprised\n&gt; timber to it, the look on his face turning to full blown incredulousness.\n&gt; &quot;You have just been through two battles, the first one nearly killed you,\n&gt; and you still haven&#39;t recovered the energon from that. And now you are\n&gt; going\n&gt; to start trying to repair others?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodimus shook his head, &quot;From what I have been told Legacy has been one of\n&gt; the ones who worked on Nightlight, why don&#39;t we let him continue to work\n&gt; as\n&gt; a medic until our two doctors are able to be recovered, assuming that is\n&gt; possible.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Legacy&#39;s single optic flashed as he looked at Tuscon and Rodimus. While he\n&gt; was face was as cold as ever, there was the impression of annoyance coming\n&gt; from him. &quot;I have the sum total of Maximal and Predacon medical,\n&gt; technological, historical and military knowledge up to approximately 57 of\n&gt; this planet years from now.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Focusing on Tuscon Legacy continued, &quot;For you to attempt repairs in your\n&gt; damaged state is both illogical and potentially detrimental to your health\n&gt; and the health of those that you are desiring to repair. You cannot know\n&gt; how\n&gt; much longer your systems will continue with out failure. Should they fail\n&gt; at\n&gt; an inopportune moment it could have catastrophic results.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Perceptor nodded and watched in silence at the dormant figure of\n&gt; &gt; Megatron,\n&gt; &gt; after a large while he followed Tucson and said &quot;I offer mi asistance...\n&gt; &gt; and I have somne ideas to keep safe the ark and with out changes for our\n&gt; &gt; time line&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Windlord and kup went inside the ark and closed it down, they walked\n&gt; towards\n&gt; &gt; the cr chambers and windlord opened his comlink to Rodimus and Tucson\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Windlord and Kup to the Primes... the Ark is locked down, we request\n&gt; &gt; permition to go to a Cr&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson nodds to Perceptor with a smile of appreciation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Thank you Perceptor, of course, you&#39;re welcome to assist me and I could\n&gt; always use some advice.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He opens the channel to Windlord and Kup.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Permission granted Windlord and Kup. Rest easy my friends.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As Windlord and Kup step into the recharging chamber, the fuzors also show\n&gt; up. From the damage on their frames they have the same thought in mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good battle.&quot; Noctorro said to Kup and Windlord, &quot;But I look forward to a\n&gt; time when we can live in peace, and will not be battling the Predacons.&quot;\n&gt; He\n&gt; sighed as his CR chamber opened. He turned and stepped back into it.\n&gt;\n&gt; The other Fuzor&#39;s followed suit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;As long as Hydras is still around it won&#39;t happen!&quot; Bantor said\n&gt; sarcastically.\n&gt;\n&gt; Torca nodded sagely, &quot;There may yet come a time.&quot; He said as he checked\n&gt; over\n&gt; his soldiers and then stepped into his own chamber. &quot;But until then we\n&gt; must\n&gt; be vigilant.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He nodded as the door of the recharge pod closed and he begins the\n&gt; proccess\n&gt; of being repaired.\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo!
