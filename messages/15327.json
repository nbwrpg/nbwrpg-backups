The lab was off limits to the wolf due to the \nneed for secrecy.\n\n&quot;So why did you choose this planet to explore?&quot; Lunarpine asked full \nof curiosity. \n\n&quot;This particular planet has an abundance of life, Translife and \norganic life seemed to have molded into a new translife form. Truly \nyou must marvel in the works of nature here.&quot; Veratis replied, his \nvoice full of wonderment. &quot;Imagine the possibilities of organic \ntransformation, if we could program the stasis pods with DNA it would \nmake scanners obsolete. We could land explorers on planetsvoid of \nlife with the abilities of creatures from similar planets. It will be \na new age for exploration and colinazation.\n\nLunarpine could see the good purpose in what Veratis was doing but \nunfortunately he could imagine other possibilities too. If he could \nimagine them he was sure that others such as the preds could think of \nthem too.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
