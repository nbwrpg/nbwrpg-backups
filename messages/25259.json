Bots like him were exatly what had kept the Maximals back \nthroughout the Beast Wars. While leaders were considered weak, they \nwere hampered by the bots that spoke out against them, and could do \nnothing but indeed be weak. Prowl could feel the dissapointment from \nIron Raptor, and hear her thoughts, and that didn&#39;t improve the \nsituation.\n\n-Don&#39;t worry, my love, you&#39;re faring better than Liono did. They can \nyell at you, but they are under your command, and as long as you make \ngood decisions, they will remain so.- He replied to her, looking at \nthe Maximals. He watched several of them report in, and then looked \nat FZ. There was little doubt why the Alliance had gotten the upper \nhand in the war: the Maximals were slow to rally.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKluster approached Iron Raptor, saluting with his one remaining hand.\n\n&quot;Kluster reporting, Ma&#39;am!&quot;\n\nBehind him, a battered Grimmler also saluted. &quot;Grimmler reporting.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA nearly-dead Proto stumbled into the cluster of Maximals, also \nsaluting. &quot;Proto reporting, commander.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm walked back to the Maximals around IR, also saluting \nher. &quot;Firearm here.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFZ looked over at the Maximals, shaking his head. It was no wonder \nthey had failed to defend themselves at this battle, not with them \nbeing so divided. He watched calmly as one of their number began \npreparing for an attack.\n\nFZ activated his comm to Iron Raptor&#39;s frequency. &quot;You do realize \nthat if your troops continue to fire, mine will be forced to destroy \nyour base?&quot;\n\nClosing the link to IR, he opened one to Deemos. &quot;Deemos, would you \nmind telling the Chosen Ones to stand down? The battle is over, we \nhave won, and I&#39;m negotiating us getting some troops back from this.&quot;\n\nClosing that connection, he looked around, waiting.\n\n\n"}}
