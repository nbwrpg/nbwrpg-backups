It was better that nobody reported her wandering the ship \nor Zardus might reconsider her worth to him. she returned to her \nresearch knowing that Zardus would want a sample of her work. He \ncould walk in on her at any time and expect a sample at a moments \nnotice.\n\nOOC for future reference can Najah order a lockdown of the lab or \ndoes Zardus have to do it?\n\n\n"}}
