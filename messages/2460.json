But she didn&#39;t like being lied to either. She had heard Prowl&#39;s half finished sentence and knew what he was going to say but had stopped, she also knew that that would be a promise that he may not have been able to keep.\nIron Raptor then looked at Prowl, she knew that he was worried about her and thus would wish her to stay in Beast Mode. So she would, it wasn&#39;t all that uncomfortable that she couldn&#39;t stay in it until they came back to base. But the fact that she had snapped when it wasn&#39;t necessary bothered her a bit.*\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sorry if I acted crabby, nerves.&quot;\n\n* She then looked at Prowl more closely, he didn&#39;t seem to be much better off then she was. He seemed just as damaged as she was and she knew that he needed to rest as much as she did, perhaps they could just walk a ways and then travel by air when he felt up to it?*\n\n&quot; We can...walk a bit before we have to...fly. Recover a bit as well?&quot;\n\n* Just as he was worried about her, she was just as worried about him.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
