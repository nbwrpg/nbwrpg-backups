Lucky for him he \nhad emergency reserves subspaced within his draconic body.  He opens up the \nleft front haunch compartment and reveals a line of canisters.\n\n&quot; I&#39;m sure many of you need fuel.  Help yourselves but try to consider \nothers who are Also in need of refueling.&quot; I have a second reserve on my \nright side.&quot;\n\nWhile with Waspinator, Straight Shot giggles with delight.  She loved a \nlittle thrill seeking and being almost dropped was actually exciting to her.\n\n&quot; That&#39;s okay, it was actually kinda fun.  I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to \nfly and I&#39;m enjoying it.&quot;\n\nShe transforms into her robot mode and catches hold to Waspinator&#39;s spindly \nlegs, keeping a sure but gentile grip on it.  She keeps her beacon on track \nmode while flying with what could very well be an evolving friendship.  She \nlooks up to Waspinator with a smile and a thumbs up.\n\n&quot; We&#39;re still on track, and my beacon is  rapidly flashing.  We must be \ngetting close.&quot;\n\nShe now swings herself up onto his back, carefully minding his wings.  She \nproves to be a very light passenger as she rides contently on the Predacon&#39;s \nback.\n\n&quot;I never thought that I would ever make friends among enemies but, I think I \njust did.  Nobody has ta know anything except for us.   What&#39;d ya say? \nFriends?  I promise never ta tell Leo or Rodimus.  Tucson will understand \nbut I don&#39;t think the other two will.&quot;\n\nShe couldn&#39;t exactly tell what was happening to her but whatever it was, \ncertainly didn&#39;t bother her in the least.\n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly busy.\n\nOn Aug 11, 2011, at 5:14 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With deep breaths, Tucson cools down as nostrils flair to allow faster\n&gt;&gt; cooling of his systems.  At the same time he raises his neck for another\n&gt;&gt; look around.  Then his head is swung ahead facing northward once again. \n&gt;&gt; His\n&gt;&gt; long tail snaps at the ground beneath him, taking out what remains of the\n&gt;&gt; dinosaur bones, smashing them to splinters.  It felt good to roar, it \n&gt;&gt; helped\n&gt;&gt; to release trapped emotions that had built up over time.  Certainly \n&gt;&gt; Rodimus\n&gt;&gt; was trying his patience and it was a good method of not lashing out at \n&gt;&gt; him\n&gt;&gt; which would have been a grave mistake.  He continues to wait for the \n&gt;&gt; Fuzors\n&gt;&gt; to arrive.  He thinks to himself as he does.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As TUSCON waited for the Maximal fuzors the other Predacons seemed to\n&gt; give him a wide berth. DEEPSTRYKE continued to hover into the air far\n&gt; above, his sensors probing over the dinosaurs, the Predacons and the\n&gt; Maximals, missing very little.\n&gt;\n&gt; The predacons that could fly were still hover over the dinosaurs just\n&gt; watching the flames, their fire and heat doing all the work of\n&gt; destroying the dinosaur flesh. However the work was slow gooing and\n&gt; the Predacons were begining to mumble.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This is burning up my heat exchanger.&quot; One said.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another said, &quot;Yeah along with all our fuel reserves.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a pause as others began mumbling something similar all under\n&gt; their breath.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Straightshot&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Till all are one.   I most certainly hope you&#39;re right about \n&gt;&gt; this,Primus.\n&gt;&gt; Our lives depend on your theory.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, having been above in Waspinator&#39;s grasp, Straight Shot could\n&gt;&gt; actually sense some good attributes in him if there were any to be \n&gt;&gt; sensed.\n&gt;&gt; Although they could never be allies she still could sense something \n&gt;&gt; positive\n&gt;&gt; about him.  His sense of sticking to things even if he didn&#39;t like doing\n&gt;&gt; them, was admirable and she felt he should be complemented.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Waspinator, look I know you hate me with a passion and you aren&#39;t \n&gt;&gt; exactly\n&gt;&gt; on my friends list but I want you to know that I really admire your \n&gt;&gt; loyalty\n&gt;&gt; toward this mission and having the tolerance to work with an enemy bot.\n&gt;&gt; You&#39;re doing a really good job, keep it up.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; WASPINATOR flies a little higher as his wings buzz, &quot;Waspinator is\n&gt; better than dumb Maximals!&quot; he says as he scans over the dinosaur\n&gt; remains. &quot;But sometimes some Maximals do have a good point.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In his glee over STRAIGHTSHOT&#39;s comment WASPINATOR almost dropped her,\n&gt; but then buzzed down to catch her. &quot;Sorry.&quot; he said sheepishly before\n&gt; flying on.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Elita&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elita paled and slight shaken qhen Sourge was around and she asked in low\n&gt;&gt; voice to  Nightshift “do you think that scourge eats little kittens?”\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Nightshift&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nightshift keeps tabs on Scourge, being sure he keeps his distance.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot; Good question, I think we better keep tabs on him.  Know&#39;n that \n&gt;&gt; slagball,\n&gt;&gt; he&#39;s look&#39;n ta stir up some trouble.  But I don&#39;t think he eats kittens.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; SCOURGE chuckled as he looked down on NIGHTSHIFT, his powerful sensors\n&gt; desinged for tracking fleeing prey and searching for Maximals were\n&gt; easily able to pick up on the conversation. &quot;I have no designs on such\n&gt; a little Maximal. There would be no sport in it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Still in his hover craft mode SCOURGE just ahead, watching the\n&gt; terrain. &quot;One would think that such a young thing would not be out\n&gt; here in such a dangerous place.&quot; SCOURGE&#39;s words were not precisly\n&gt; caring as much as they were the words of a pure predator. There was\n&gt; nothing specifically dangerous in them, but the tone indicated that\n&gt; maybe there was.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Hydras&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; hYDRAS hissed anoyed and said “What a waste of power, this saberback \n&gt;&gt; could\n&gt;&gt; have done a better use of his skills”\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD - Tuscon&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tucson looks to Hydras,with a sarcastic expression.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;If you think you can do better, be my guest.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;NEW - Fractyl&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A Predacon, his IFF signature identifying him as FRACTYL came flying\n&gt; up to the area, from the southwest, his beast mode was a greenish\n&gt; colored Pteranodon. He flew over a few of the closer dinosaurs and\n&gt; began spraying them with some sort of caustic liquid. More smoke and\n&gt; black smoke rose from them, but the affect was that the creatures\n&gt; began to melt as they were hit.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Hydras!&quot; FRACTLY said excitedly over his comlink. &quot;I think I have\n&gt; another, faster way to rid ourselves of these deceased reptiles.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
