Back on Cybertron \nthey had those neat little cube things they had just invented. Pity \nthey didn&#39;t have any over here.\n\nEspecially the caramel flavoured ones...\n\nWith a sigh she took a step forwards, but her step was halted by the \nsentance Carnage had practically spat. Her eyes widened in shock. \n&quot;No! Of course I wouldn&#39;t do that! I would never ever do such a \nthing..&quot;\n\nThe prospect of even aiming a gun at her friend seemed like a sin to \nher! How Carnage could think about her doing such a thing was.. \nbeyond her knowledge. But Teltoli knew anger had to be brewing inside \nher friend since she had left.. anger at her.\n\nTeltoli stood up and trotted after Carnage as she began to walk away. \nShe too could feel a storm brewing, and the directioon they were \nheaded.. she wasn&#39;t sure about, but she trusted Carnage and decided \nto follow her.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t.. leave.. because of nothing you know. My Father and my \nGeneral called me back to Cybertron. I got a promotion, and if I \ndidn&#39;t leave promptly, the promotion would have been cancelled..&quot; She \nsaid quietly, but she knew it was loud enough for Carnage&#39;s ears.\n\nBut anyone could have felt the unspoken question between them. &#39;Why \ndidn&#39;t you tell anyone?&#39; Teltoli mentally asked herself, imagining it \nwas someone else asking her. She braced herself.\n\n&quot;I didn&#39;t tell anyone because it&#39;s a highly classified mission that I \nwas put in charge of. It appears Cybertron made some new enemies, and \nwe were sent to infiltrate their planet. I was in charge, and since I \napparantly did a good job, I got promoted..&quot; She explained, hoping \nCarnage would understand.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry for not telling you, I truely am, if I could take back my \nactions I would, but it had to be done. And no, I don&#39;t obey my \nSuperiors to the point of shooting my friends&quot; Her lips quirked in a \nsmile, but she fought it down and waited.\n\n\n"}}
