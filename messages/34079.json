Two of the shells hit him in\n&gt;the back, exploding with a loud blast of noise, and sent the Decepticon\n&gt;falling towards Shockwave.\n&gt;\n&gt;Beastbox on the other hand was glad that Incinerator had turned his\n&gt;attention to Speedbreaker. He maneuvered himself towards the enemy now,\n&gt;closing the gap between them. He fired again as he aproached.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
