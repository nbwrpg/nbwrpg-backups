Hot Rod is talking with Starice, and I couldn&#39;t take Epyon cause that would put me over the char limit.\n\n\n::Killfest/Scyther/Inarcinator/Slayer::\n\nKillfest looks around himself, spotting DrillBit after Shivah told him where he was. He checks where his troops were and sends a reply transmission to Shivah:\n\n&quot;My troops are too far away to help with the Trainer, and I can&#39;t fly and am too far away to catch up by foot. Some of DrillBit&#39;s might be able to help however.&quot;\n\nHe punches his way through a large charred boulder and reaches DrillBit. &quot;How are your troops?&quot; he asks the fellow commander.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScyther and Incarcinator were almost to the Blackfortress no, carrying EndBringer and Demise with them.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSlayer swears, making a very sharp left and feeling shots dig into his side. He didn&#39;t keep track of how many hit him, but his armor was cracked and leaking fluid. His scanners report that two of the bots have left, and only one was following him now.\n\n&quot;Much better,&quot; he says to himself and suddenly spins around, transforming into robot mode and unleashing 4 shots from each of his shoulder blasters at Kali, Ignatius now tucked under his arm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Shivah::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;uh oh&quot;said Shivah when he recived tht message that was time to go to \n&gt; train &quot;Wait a sec, commander Killfest&quot;the male open his comm link to \n&gt; Luzbel and Attilla&quot;Luzbel and Attilla, go to this coordinates \n&gt; NOW!!!!!&quot; he opened his comm link to Killfest &quot;Darkfate is speaking \n&gt; with the new faction, by now I&#39;m in charge; Drillbit coordinates is 2-\n&gt; 5-0...
