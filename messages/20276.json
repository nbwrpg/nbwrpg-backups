She felt a twinge of pain as her other wing \nstated to fall off her right shoulder. She growled and reached over \nher shoulder and ripped it off.  The deep red fluid started to flow \ndown her shoulder and down her side. Her white fur was turning \ncrimson from the blood. She threw down her wings and looked at \nVeratis. &quot;So now I am a new life form.&quot; She growled. She wasn&#39;t sure \nquite what to do or what to make of all this. She lowered herself \ndown on all fours. Her shoulders were dripping with the red fluid.\n&quot;So now that I am this...new form. Give me a new name.  I am no \nlonger the bot Shadow Wing.&quot;  She looked down. &quot;No...I am no longer \nthe embodement of Shadow Wing. I am still who I am, but no longer \nwhat I was. Veratis, you made this change possable. I ask you...give \nme a name.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; (Sorry I missed yesterday, work had me busy.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Veratis studied the results of the scans from the CR chamber. &quot;The \nvirus\n&gt; seems to have mutated your DNA into a dominant organic form.&quot; you \nare\n&gt; something new to translife.&quot; He had a flare for the obvious. the \nlife form\n&gt; he&#39;d been trying for so long to create was now a reality.\n\n\n\n"}}
