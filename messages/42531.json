Sorry! and thanx about Tankor\n\nAs the new robots arrived, Daemos grinned, while Belthassan seemed to \nconcentrate. The task would be hard, but he could do it.\n\nDaemos:\nGood! Now we can start! Who wishes to go first?\n\nTankor took a step forward:\nI shall be the first. What do I have to do?\n\nBelthassan:\nFollow us. We will do this in the sanctuary.\n\nThe sanctuary was a large, round room, filled with techno-organic \nflowers and vines. At its center was a large circle.\n\nBelthassan:\nPlease be seated at the center of the circle.\n\nTankor sat down, while Daemos and Belthassan sat at the edge of the \ncircle, facing Tankor.\n\nDaemos was unususlly calm. His sarcasm had evaporated and a more \nserious part of him was at work.\n\nDaemos:\nNow Tankor, you will become a true Tripredacus. You shall know every \nounce of the Tripredacus Mysticism. You shall become...\n\nBelthassan:\n...one with the Matrix.\n\nA strong beam fired from the sparks of the two commander and hit \nTankor fully. He felt no pain though. A blinding light bathed the \nentire room. Tankor&#39;s mind opened and he saw the circle beneath him \ndisrupt, the floor collapsing and him falling in the void and into a \nlarge roung gate, filled with the sparks of all those gone and all \nthose yet to be. The oracle. The artefact that gave the Tripredacus \ntheir power. Then the Matrix, the flow of the sparks. And he saw his \nown spark, and he knew he somehow had linked its destiny to the \nMatrix. And then he saw the Tripredacus and their sacred duty: to \nbestow the power of the Matrix upon all Transformers, by any means \npossible. He felt pride, joy and he felt humble at serving the Matrix.\n\nThe light then faded away. He saw Belthassan slowly collapsing on his \nside.\n\nBelthassan:\nTankor of the Tripredacus, welcome to the power of the Matrix!\n\nTankor then realized he was changed, both phisically and mentally. He \nwas calmer now...\n\nOOC:Thanx Lord! Now you decide whatever form you want him to be! Your \nother chars will feel something alike when they are reformatted.\n\n\n"}}
