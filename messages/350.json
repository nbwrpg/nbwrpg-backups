It was beginning to get boring!\nDinobot sighed as he continued to walk, no warrior should be idle for too \nlong!\nHe watched the surroundings but took note that Tavatron was keeping perfect \npace with him, but that wasn&#39;t surprising.\nIt was then that Dinobot thought about the Maximals that he once knew, \nOptimus, Rhinox, Rattrap, Cheetor, and SilverBolt...what happened and where \nwere they?(he doesn&#39;t know that some of them are still around.)\nDinobot looked at Tavatron then back in the direction that they were \nheading, did she know?\nThere was no harm in trying to find out.*\n\n&quot; Do you know what happened to my comrades?&quot;\n\n* Besides, they had to pass the time some how.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
