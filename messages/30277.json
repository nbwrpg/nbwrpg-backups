Her \nleopard skin was starting to fall off.  Her arms and legs were bare metal.  \nHer tail was barren of skin as well and her face looked like she had on an \nold cat mask instead of her normal skin.  She fell to her knees and cried. \nAs soon as she hit the ground, the rest of her skin fell off her metalic \nbody.  She was now all crome.  Her looked like a full figured, slender, \ncrome plated feline female bot.  The pain was starting to subside but she \nwas still in agony.  She lay on her side on the ground, in the old leopard \nskin that once covered her body.  She meowed quietly, pulling the fur over \nher body and curled up in her old pelt.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
