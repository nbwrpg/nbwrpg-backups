She saw Dollen&#39;s body \nlayng there.  She jumped out of the front window of the pod and ran \nto him.  She knealed down next to him and craddled his head.  She \nlooked to see how badly he was hurt. &quot;Can you hear me? Please, wake \nup.&quot;  She tried to pick him up, but he was too heavy to lift.  She \nlooked around hoping someone had seen the crash and come to them.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;dcoburn&quot; &lt;dcoburn@n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::Dollen::\n&gt; \n&gt;         The pod kept flying, and Dollen looked at some scenery \nwhile flying.\n&gt; Soon, he spotted the base below.  He slowly flew downwards, \ncarefully.\n&gt; Suddenly, an image of the beautiful bot struck his mind.  He \njumped, and he\n&gt; accidentally pushed the steering handle to the left.  The pod went \nracing\n&gt; diagonally going straight towards the ground.  He knew they were \ngoing to\n&gt; crash.  He got out of his seat, and jumped in front of GoldenEye to \nprevent\n&gt; her from flying out.  The pod hit the ground, and went skidding.  \nIt hit a\n&gt; tree, and Dollen went flying right through the windshield and hit \nthe tree.\n&gt; He lay on the front of the smashed up pod, lifelessly.  They were \njust\n&gt; outside the base, luckily they hadn&#39;t crashed into it.  But Dollen \nwasn&#39;t so\n&gt; lucky.\n\n\n"}}
