Hmm..&quot;\n=\r\n\nHe had not told Big Convoy that he had spent most of his time living as a =\r\nvisually impaired Autobot. But a bit of visual impairment did not scare him=\r\n, he was used to it.  It&#39;s not long before the room goes black on him once =\r\nagain.  But instead of panic, he straightens up, and cocks his ears to the =\r\ndirection of the cell entrance.  Footsteps.  They were very far off but he =\r\ncould hear them with surprising clarity, and for once was happy to have his=\r\n sense of hearing returned.  Along with that his sense of touch and taste w=\r\nere also enhanced as he uses his nostrils to feel the rise of temperatures =\r\nin the room,\n\n&quot; Ah, that was part of my problem.  I am not used to working =\r\nwith vision, I&#39;ve lived with blindness most of my life and have learned to =\r\nadapt.  That is who I am and trying to change that has left a bit of a void=\r\n.  But now I understand, through darkness there is light, even though my ey=\r\nes were never meant to see it.  I can do this, I can fight Rodimus and no m=\r\natter how well he was trained, one can never see the way a sightless warrio=\r\nr can.  He may be trained but he has never lost his sight.  I have and I ha=\r\nve learned to compensate for it&quot; \n\nPerpetually on the move and constantly b=\r\nusy. \n\nOn Oct 11, 2011, at 2:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson looks around at those who were paying at=\r\ntention and nods to them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Freedom is the right of all sentient be=\r\nings.

But a bit of visual impairment did not scare =\r\nhim, he was used to it. &nbsp;It&#39;s not long before the room goes black on h=\r\nim once again. &nbsp;But instead of panic, he straightens up, and cocks his=\r\n ears to the direction of the cell entrance. &nbsp;Footsteps. &nbsp;They we=\r\nre very far off but he could hear them with surprising clarity, and for onc=\r\ne was happy to have his sense of hearing returned. &nbsp;Along with that hi=\r\ns sense of touch and taste were also enhanced as he uses his nostrils to fe=\r\nel the rise of temperatures in the room,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot; Ah, tha=\r\nt was part of my problem. &nbsp;I am not used to working with vision, I&#39;ve =\r\nlived with blindness most of my life and have learned to adapt. &nbsp;That =\r\nis who I am and trying to change that has left a bit of a void. &nbsp;But n=\r\now I understand, through darkness there is light, even though my eyes were =\r\nnever meant to see it. &nbsp;I can do this, I can fight Rodimus and no matt=\r\ner how well he was trained, one can never see the way a sightless warrior c=\r\nan. &nbsp;He may be trained but he has never lost his sight. &nbsp;I have a=\r\nnd I have learned to compensate for it&quot;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-comp=\r\nosition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-fram=\r\ne-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perpet=\r\nually on the move and constantly busy.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Oct 11, 2011,=\r\n at 2:30 PM, Super Cyclonus &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:supercyclonus@...&quot;&gt;=\r\nsupercyclonus@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote =\r\ntype=3D&quot;cite&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Tucson looks around at those who were paying attention and nods to the=\r\nm.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.
