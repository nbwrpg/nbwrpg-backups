And besides, I am a \nPredacon, not a Decpeticon. Different programs. Besides, trust isn&#39;t \nsomething that my programs deal with easily.&quot;  She took a closer step \nand looked into his optics.  &quot;Trust must be earned on both sides.&quot;  \nShe turned and took a few paces away from him. Her voice showing \nrestraint as she tried to keep her emotional chip at bay. &quot;Besides, \nI&#39;m a warrior. And a Predacon warrior trusts no one.&quot;  She lowered \nher head and closed her optics. &quot;No matter how.....much they might \nwant to.&quot;  Her spark wanted him, but she knew that she couldn&#39;t let \nher spark go. Not to a maximal. Not now, not with the war. Not yet. \n\n\n\nCam::\nShe had crouched down and snuck up behind one of the drones. She \ncrept right next to it, then, with her little reflexes, she jumped up \non top of the drone. It spun around. She held  tight and reached for \nthe deactivation button.  She pressed it and the drone sank to the \nground. She sat up in fox kit mode and looked at Blackfang and \nKitKat. Neither bot was paying attention to her. So, she decided to \nfix that. She yelled at them in her small voice, &quot;HEY! LOOK! I DID \nIT!&quot;\n\n\nKitKat::\nShe turned and looked at the little maximal. &quot;Well done kid. Now get \nthe rest of them. One is good, but let&#39;s see if you can do that every \ntime.&quot;\n\nCamoflage::\nShe did a back flip and yelped back. &quot;SURE I CAN! JUST YOU WATCH!&quot;  \nAnd off she went to take out the next drone.\n\nKitKat::\nShe couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &quot;Ahh, and she reminds me of me when I \nwas that young. Out to prove that I could take on the universe with a \nsingle paw.&quot; she said with another chuckle and a smile.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; He decided to keep his thpughts to himself for a few moments and to\n&gt; start the exercice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blackfang: Ready Cam?

Windlord\n&gt; trusts Empath, and she&#39;s a Decepticon. Likewise, I could get to \ntrust\n&gt; you. If you are trustworthy to me, then even my commanders would \nhave\n&gt; nothing to say about it, not even old Yggie. Now, the question is,\n&gt; would you let me trust you?\n&gt; \n&gt; He was looking intently in her eyes with a mix of hope and sadness. \nHe\n&gt; loved her very much, and even if they had opposed ideologies, it\n&gt; mattered not to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;logomorph@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She jumped up and down at Blackfang. &quot;Oh Yeah!

She reminded her \nof \n&gt; &gt; herself at that age. Ready to show the whole of Cybertron that \nshe \n&gt; &gt; was out to be the best pred out there. She shook her head \nslightly. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Think you got what it takes huh kid?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; &gt; She shook her head up and down. &quot;Oh yeah! I can take them out. \nEasy. \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang showed me how. Just have to jump on the tops of them \nand \n&gt; &gt; hit the switch on the back. I&#39;ve been practicing. I&#39;m not as good \nas \n&gt; &gt; Blackfang yet. But I will be soon. I just have to get a little \n&gt; &gt; bigger.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; She nodded her head. &quot;You know kid, you&#39;d make a good predacon \none of \n&gt; &gt; these days.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Camoflage:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Predacon? Aren&#39;t they bad?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Bad? Since when was a Predacon bad? All we want is the right to \nrule \n&gt; &gt; this planet as we are destined to. Predacons are supposed to rule \n&gt; &gt; over all the CyberLife. It&#39;s been told to us since the dawn of \n&gt; &gt; Cybertron. I just can&#39;t figure out why the maximals stand in the \nway \n&gt; &gt; of that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; She scratched the top of her head. &quot;Why are the Predacons \nsupposed to \n&gt; &gt; make up all the rules? Why can&#39;t we just be friends? Like we are \nnow?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; She looked at Blackfang and sighed heavily. She felt her welcome \n&gt; &gt; would be short lived. She turned and looked at Cam. &quot;Look little \none. \n&gt; &gt; The matrix has set things into action. We Preds are going to \nfight \n&gt; &gt; for our right to rule. And the Maximals will forever stand in the \nway \n&gt; &gt; of that destiny. We will never get along. It&#39;s just not ment to \nbe.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Camoflage::\n&gt; &gt; She walked up to KitKat and stood infront of her. &quot;But we&#39;re \nfriends. \n&gt; &gt; If we are friends, then why can&#39;t the others just be friends like \nwe \n&gt; &gt; are?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; KitKat::\n&gt; &gt; She knelt down and looked Cam in the optics. &quot;Because kid, no \nMaximal \n&gt; &gt; will ever trust a Predacon if his spark depended on it. No bot \ncan go \n&gt; &gt; against thier own programming,&quot; she looked up at Blackfang, &quot;no \n&gt; &gt; matter how much they want to.&quot;  She looked back at Cam. &quot;Now, \nlet&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; see you take on a drone by yourself.&quot; She patted Cam on the head \nand \n&gt; &gt; stood up. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Nic&quot; &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Blackfang glanced shyly at Kitkat, then looked back at Cam.
