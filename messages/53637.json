Our \n&gt; original mission was to find and arrest him.  But another group of \n&gt; Predacons turned up led by Galvatron - the mutated nutcase that \n&gt; Unicron made of the original Megatron.  He&#39;d been reformatted to a \n&gt; Pred himself and the two got into a fight.  There was an accident, \n&gt; and the two fused.  Boom!  Instant super-robot!
