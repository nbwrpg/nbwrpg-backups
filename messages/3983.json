A hiss escaped her mouth from between clenched teth as she saw the ground rush away and leave her stomach down there with it!\nShe then looked back towards Prowl, everyhting had happened to fast! First she was waiting for Oblitertron to make up it&#39;s mind but then braced herself for destruction when she saw it rais it&#39;s gun towards her, then she was suddenly pushed from the side and out of the way of the blast.\nThen her stomach lurched when she was then launched into the air and then the next thing she knew she was looking into Prowl&#39;s optics...over 100 feet above the ground!\nShe shook her head to clear it after hearing Liono tell them to get to safety, this was not going the way that she had planned! She wanted to calm Oblitertron but now,with Liono firing at it there was no chance. Iron Raptor wriggled in Prowl&#39;s grasp, she had to stop Liono from firing!*\n\n&quot; No! Let me go...put me down! I have to stop him from firing! Eh! Let me go, Prowl!!&quot;\n\n* There was no hope in  stoppingh Liono from firing and she knew it...but she also knew that Prowl wouldn&#39;t drop her into the face of danger either.\nIron Raptor sighed as she then gave up and looked down towards the firing Liono...her voice disappointed and hopeless.*\n\n&quot; No.&quot;\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
