But they could easily move into the number one \nspot since they teamed up with Megatron.&quot; He smiled and turned back \nto KitKat &quot;But with your leadership qualities I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all be \nsafe.&quot;\n12584\n\n&quot;Again Phobia smiled, &quot;I have a small colection of weapons from all \nmy victims, and the heavy weapons from the warship I was formerly \nstationed on.&quot; he stepped forward closer to KitKat as if trying not \nto be overheard. &quot;You remember the weapon I was carrying when I first \narrived? Well it just happens I have an entire crate filled with \nthem.&quot; he steps back a little. &quot;In the battle my rifle was only set \non 25% power. If Megatron knew that then I&#39;d be in trouble. Always \nremember, don&#39;t use full power until you know who to trust with that \npower.&quot;\n\n12651\nKit Kat left the ship in a hurry, Phobia walked to his \nconsole, &quot;Replay last incoming message to KitKat&quot; the ship replayed \nthe distress signal KitKat had recieved. &quot;Good, saving those twowill \nincrease her popularity.&quot; his plan was falling together nicely.\n\n\n\n"}}
