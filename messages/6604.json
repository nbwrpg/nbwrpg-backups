But that was also a good thing as well as disappointing, it meant that Prowl and himself could get straight down to work.\nWithout a second glance towards the chared battle field he approached the Ark, the sound of shorting wires clearly heard echoing through the basically empty halls.\nMost bots had cleared what they had owned out of the ship, though not really knowing that but guessing so from the lack of bot�s selvaging.\nDinobot growled as he approached the main doors and transformed into his robot mode, simply pushing them aside and walking in clearly.\nHe snarled in annoyance at the disorder about base floor, it very obvious that it had taken more damage then he had first thought.\nBut without any more time to waste, the Pit knowing what could be happening to the two fembots, he switched to a scan of the ship and located Prowl near the equiptmeant room. A good place to be, or he would have thought him unadle to think for himself without another to help him.\nBut Prowl was a liable bot, or so he had turned out so far. There was more yet to be see.\nDinobot picked his way through the rubbish upon the floor and made his way towards the equiptment room, finally seeing Prowl.\nWith no hesitation he approached the owl with a snarl but it wasn�t meant towards him, there had been nothing but desterbing thoughts in Dinobot�s mind every step of the way there�and he wasn�t comfortable with having to waste time with this.\nWith the rise of his worry there was also a rise to his agression, a fact in which Prowl would have to notice and keep in mind if he was to get along with Dinobot. Both of their cooperation was needed in this situation, they had to put up with eachother.\nHis expression was nothing other then aggressive, calculative, and fed up. Mostly the same way he had ever looked before, but with a very trained optic one could tell that he was agitated.\nDinobot growled towards Prowl�*\n\n� You called me here for equiptment?�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
