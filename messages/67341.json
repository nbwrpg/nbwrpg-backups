For a moment there is a\n    reprieve as sweeps expl=\r\node with a satisfying blaze of fire and light.\n    But then more come from =\r\ndifferent directions. It&#39;s like firing into a\n    swarm, you hit a few, and=\r\n a few more come. Their attacks coming from\n    everywhere above them and t=\r\no the sides, laser blasts and disintegration\n    beams rock their fortified=\r\n area, seeking to terminate those housed\n    within!\n\n    Without any comma=\r\nnds from Nightstrike and Darkfate the sweeps around\n    the Maximal base ju=\r\nst continue to pound on it from above, seemingly\n    content to keep anythi=\r\nng on the inside the base pent up there. Anything\n    so foolish as to step=\r\n out of its doors face their cannons with a most\n    grueling intensity!\n\n =\r\n   In the air above Scourge is only slightly impressed as the Maximal\n    (=\r\nRavenchief) evades his blast, hoever it is the fact that he is ignored\n    =\r\ntotally that sets his nerves on edge. It is then they his proximity\n    ala=\r\nrms flip on warning him of the incoming missiles. He chuckles, &quot;Only\n    si=\r\nx?? They don&#39;t know me!&quot; With a blast of power he drops down to near\n    st=\r\nreet level, zipping between tall buildings, far more agile then\n    simple =\r\nmissiles. As several of them hit structures rather then him his\n    laugh e=\r\nchoes through the streets below. \n\n    Scourge&#39;s laugh slows a bit as he re=\r\nalizes that a few missiles continue\n    to follow him then. &quot;Heat seekers.&quot;=\r\n He grumbles for a moment and then\n    chuckles, &quot;This should be fun!&quot; Flyi=\r\nng towards one of the large\n    buildings he peppers it with laser fire, se=\r\ntting it ablaze. Then with a\n    mighty thrust from his hover jets, which p=\r\nut out much less heat, he\n    pushes to the side and around the building as=\r\n the building which is now\n    much hotter then he receives the brunt of th=\r\ne remaining missile\n    strikes. His laugh echoes once again through the st=\r\nreets as several\n    sweeps meet him there and begin to rain destruction! \n=\r\n\n    In the air somewhat closer to the shoreline, Cyclonus had continued in=\r\n\n    the direction he was going, his jets flaring with power, the wind\n    =\r\nalmost screaming as it moved past him! As his own missiles exploded\n    spe=\r\nctacularly at the railing he merely flew through blaze, with all the\n    at=\r\ntendant dramatic glory, allowing the heat of the explosion to either\n    at=\r\ntract Ravenchief&#39;s missiles attention or detonate them. In either\n    case =\r\nhe rose high into the air, careful to stay out of the line of fire\n    from=\r\n those on the shoreline below, as the missles just added to the\n    wreckag=\r\ne that fell towards the waters below. \n\n    Shifting to his robot mode, Cyc=\r\nlonus turned his gaze to the approaching\n    Ravenchief, his form seeming t=\r\no almost radiate power as he floated in\n    mid air. He is tall and almost =\r\nregal, seeming to be almost made for the\n    air boued as he was on powerfu=\r\nl thrusters that took the place of his\n    feet. \n\n    His voice is deep an=\r\nd resonate, exactly the pitch and timber of the\n    Cyclonus of old, &quot;Is th=\r\nis what you wanted Maximal?&quot; Cyclonus lets go\n    with two more missiles, q=\r\nuickly the air behind them began to spin, then\n    ripple and finally burst=\r\n aflame as they pulled away from Cyclonus and\n    streaked towards Ravenchi=\r\nef!\n\n    At the shoreline below Doc manages to hit one of the two sweeps\n  =\r\n  menacing him. However these sweeps are not jets and share very few of\n   =\r\n their frailties; they are made for hunting and pursuing hostile prey,\n    =\r\nand their armor is extremely durable. The laser fire smokes along the\n    s=\r\nurface of the sweep&#39;s armor, leaving a nasty gash, but does not bring\n    i=\r\nt down. The sweeps just slow and stop just over the edge of the water\n    a=\r\nnd open up with a barrage of laser fire at Doc&#39;s position.\n\n    Meanwhile f=\r\nrom above several sweeps move down following Rodimus and\n    kup, also open=\r\ning up with cannon fire at the swimming and hopefully\n    helpless Maximals=\r\n below.\n\n    Preston\n    (Da&#39;minion)\n\n    _________________________________=\r\n_________________\n    Do You Yahoo!?\n    Tired of spam?
