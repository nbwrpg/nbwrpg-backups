Before I can go though, I owe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something to Rodimus. I also want to learn more about the Tripreds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; here, and possibly stage a raid against them.

In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front of him was Optimus Prime, the venerable Autobot, the \n&gt; ideal to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attain, the fabled leader, but most of all, the grandfather \n&gt; he never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had the chance to meet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He raised a hand and passed it on the huge head of his \n&gt; ancestor.

He hated the\n&gt; &gt; Predacons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for their constant tugs on the Pax Cybertronia, but he was now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loathing against the Tripredacus.
