He had no notion of how to control it, nor had he known =\r\nwhat it was. As it reverses, he suddenly feels a good portion of power leav=\r\ne his body, yet, he was not about to abandon the act of defending himself a=\r\ngainst Hydras or Rodimus for that matter. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; Power or no power, yo=\r\nu&#39;ve abducted one of my own, and turned him into your evil pawn. No matter =\r\nthe consequence, I will stand my ground and do whatever it takes to rightfu=\r\nlly return my leader to his role as the commander of the Autobots. Even if =\r\nI have to saccrifice my own spark to accomplish my mission. That is why I&#39;m=\r\n here, not for power, not for lust, not for domination. I&#39;m here because kn=\r\now it or not, someone who was once very close to me, needs my help and I ne=\r\nver turn my hand away when a fellow comrade is in grave danger.

But rest assured Rodimus, when the ti=\r\nme is right, and you finally reach out to me, I promise my hand will be the=\r\nre to reach out to you. And when I do, I won&#39;t let go. I promise, I will no=\r\nt abandon you or this cause. As dark as you are now, you may not understand=\r\n, but hopefully one day, you will.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He then turns back to Hydras.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot; All right Hydras, I&#39;ll let you decide how you wish to fight.

He would have been glad to be rid of this annoyance, =\r\nyes, but it would have been somewhat disappointing as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\no when Rodimus was spun around by Tuscon, the Autobot may have missed the w=\r\nicked smile on his face, When Tuscon tried to ram Rodimus into a wall, he m=\r\nay not have noticed that the sound of crunching metal was not Rodimus&#39; but =\r\nthe reinrorced wall shearing and tearing under the force of the assault. It=\r\n was not the sound of Rodimkus&#39; defeat that resonated through the room, but=\r\n it was something else!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of the same teachers that had ins=\r\ntructed Tuscon had trained a young Hot Rod as well - Jazz, Prowl, Brawn, Ku=\r\np, even Optimus himself! And while Rodimus no longer clearly remembered all=\r\n these ones and what they had meant to him, thier lessons were still ground=\r\n into him, and his reflexes that had been honed over the years of battle! \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, this was no young Hot Rod that stood there before them, =\r\nbut a figure shapped by the energy of the matrix into a character of leader=\r\nship, power and ability. He no longer had access to the knowledge and wisdo=\r\nm of the matrix, the energy having been stripped from him. But that power t=\r\nhat had been imparted was still there, reconfigured by the power of the pre=\r\ndacon shell program! He was faster, stronger and far more durable then Hot =\r\nRod ever was, he was DARK RODIMUS!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So when Rodimus hit the wal=\r\nl it was not truely pain that he felt, but the elation that a true battle w=\r\nas in the making. He felt that charge that all warriors felt when they face=\r\nd a foe that had some metal! It was an eagerness twisted by Predacon progra=\r\nmming into something dark and loathsome. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So when he stood and=\r\n turned around it was not defeat in his stance but derision, &quot;So you fancy =\r\nyourself to be a Prime do you, scrappling?&quot; Rodimus said his tone still moc=\r\nking as he raised his arm, smiling as his optics glowing with energy, &quot;Well=\r\n let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; With a thought he fired a blast of plasma energy =\r\nfrom his arm mounted cannon at this new incarnation of Tuscon, who for the =\r\nmoment appeared to be posturing for Hydras!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Remember, the=\r\n matrix that is housed within Rodimus has no energy of its own, only the ho=\r\nusing. It does not have the power to reach out and transform anyone, althou=\r\ngh I do have some ideas.
