This means \n&gt; that if the scans I asked are positive, we will raid one of the \nbase. \n&gt; Our objective here is not to eradicate our enemy, only to pinpoint \n&gt; their position, if they are truly here. However, if I am right, \nthere \n&gt; should be two bases. We will divide our group and raid both bases at \n&gt; the same time.\n\nBurrock arrived soon enough. He took no time to transform to robot \nmode. His right arm consisted of the flailing tendrils that had ripped \nthe pod in two. His left arm was normal looking. He stood only 8 feet \nup, but his strength was undeniable. What was more disturbing was the \nabsence of eyes or optics sensors. The bot was blind.\n\nBurrock: You Tyrael? Who&#39;s that guy?\n\nTyrael: Yes, I am Major Tyrael (he insisted on  the Major). This is \nLieutenant Shadow Star, second in command of this group. We are the \nTripredacus Strikers, and our mission here is to find and neutralize \nMegatron. We were about to mount a raid. I think you will function \nwell with Shadow Star.\n\nBurrock: Yeah, whatever. So, SS, whaddaya have to say about me going \nwith your team?\n\n\n"}}
