The\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; object was much like a door sheild yet the main face of it was\n&gt; empty until\n&gt; &gt; it too was turned on, an energy sheild filling the gaps to provide\n&gt; &gt; protection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Xiane arrived just as Spears was blasted from her spot behind\n&gt; the metal\n&gt; &gt; plate, kneeling down he examined the bot. &quot;Hail to thee m&#39;lady, it\n&gt; seems I\n&gt; &gt; find myself on a battlefeild yet know not the very sides I face.
