He makes \nhimself think of the time they had spent in Iron Raptor&#39;s quarters \nback when the Ark was still functional, but it only makes his \nsparkbeat speed up with the memory.\n\nHe gives up trying to calm himself down and insted leans forward to \nrest a bit on Iron Raptor, taking comfort from the feeling of her \nmoving under him.\n\nTHe screen he was carrying nearly drops out of his hands, Prowl \ncatching it just in time.\n\n&quot;Sorry,&quot; he says to Iris, getting a better grip.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor just growled*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; I still don&#39;t like this...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; And just who said you had to like this? Liking it has \nnothing to do \n&gt; with it, getting through it alive is what matters.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But then Prowl picked up the monitor and got onto Iron Raptors \nback, the \n&gt; distressed she-bot shaking herself a bit to settle Prowl in the \nright spot.\n&gt; She was just as nervouse as he and she could feel it, still having \nit in her \n&gt; mind that he didn&#39;t have to do this and it wasn&#39;t worth it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iris could hear Prowls nervouse sparkbeat.*\n&gt; \n&gt; IRIS: &quot; Settle down! Being nervouse can only make it worse!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * But with that Iron Raptoe began to move off towards the direction \nwhere \n&gt; Iris said to go, to an open plain but far from any bots or ships. \nWhich \n&gt; wasn&#39;t difficult.*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
