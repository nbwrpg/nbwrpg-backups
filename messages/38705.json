She moved closer to the chamber containing Silver Scout and\nactivated the reactivation program. The chamber opened and the sleek female\nof Silver scouts bot form stepped out.\n\n&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; the mutant asked, confused at how her bot form was\nreturned to her. &quot;I thought I&#39;d lost this form forever.&quot;\n\nBlaze took her weapon from her side, ready in case the mutant had any ideas\nabout fighting her. &quot;We used the chamber to make your mutation dormant.&quot;\nThere were to many questions to ask to guess at and there was only one bot\nwho had the answers she was looking for. &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn to answer a few\nquestions like who you are and what you&#39;re doing here?&quot;\n\nSilver scout thought for a moment but decided that she didn&#39;t owe Veratis\nanything for anything he did to her. &quot;My names Silver Scout, I was near the\nAlliance base looking for someone when I caught a familiar scent.&quot; She\nwasn&#39;t sure exactly how to explain her mutation. She still wanted to keep\nVeratis&#39; secret in case she needed something to fall back on. &quot;When I was\ncreated the sequencers used DNA from another bot. She was the one I followed\nhere.&quot;\n\nBlaze sensed a half truth in there somewhere but decided that it would be\nmore important to focus on the mutation virus and how to permanently stop\nit. She&#39;d seen how Silver Scout had lost her robot mode, there was no way in\nthe pit that Blaze wanted to go through the same thing.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: CYBERWOLF4 &lt;cyberwolf4@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, June 24, 2001 2:50 AM\nSubject: Re: Blacknightmare/B laze\n\n\n&gt; Blaze reached the room with the CR chambers. She scanned Silver Scout\n&gt; thoroughly hopeing the chambers could neutralize the mutant virus. the\n&gt; chamber continued to run programs to find an answer to the problem. The\n&gt; results showed that the Virus could be stopped but it was to much a part\nof\n&gt; the mutant hawks systems to be removed. Blaze set another CR chamber to\n&gt; repeat the process on her.
