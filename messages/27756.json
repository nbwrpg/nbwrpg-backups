The \nfour that hit him hit him in the stomach and chest, leaving smoking \ndents in his armor. He aims his missiles, firing two more at \nWildrider and then flying away from the bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Wildrider transforms after this miss, and Cannonballs, as he was \nexpecting\n&gt; the missile fire. He lands on the ground, and is propelled forward \nby the\n&gt; explosion of the missiles beside him. He gets up, and whatever was \nleft of\n&gt; his dangeling wires from his head had fallen off. His exostructure \nwas\n&gt; rippe apart, all that was left was the insides of the right side, \nhis left\n&gt; side of his face was not badly damaged. He starts to laugh deeply, \nand\n&gt; turns into a cackle. &quot;Ha ha ha, me a Predacon, thats rich Maximal, \nha ha,&quot;\n&gt; with that he raises his scatterblaster rifle and pulls the trigger \ntwice,\n&gt; sending 16 lasers a ripping the air where Prowl is.\n\n\n"}}
