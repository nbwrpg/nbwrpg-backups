As \na leader, she didn&#39;t need to. But, she was ingaged to him, so part of \nher spark wanted his approval.  She knew if things got that bad, she \nwould hve to pick the team over her love. No matter how hard that \nwould be.  But in her situation, the good of the many out wayed the \ngood of the one. But somewhere in her spark, she felt that the group \nwould make the same dicision if places were reveresed.\n\n\n"}}
