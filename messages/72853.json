We have protocol to follow and no Maximal will\nbe left behind.&quot; The first voice said.\n\nTurning back to NIGHTLIGHT he continued, &quot;I am Longrack.&quot; The voice\nsaid. In the light that was shining he could be seen as a tall and\nrobust soldier, predominantly yellow/orange in the light with brown\nspots. His right hand ending in a claw rather than normal fingers.\n\nAnother voice spoke up in the dark, &quot;Protocol is not going to matter\nmuch if we&#39;re dead, we gotta move, now. More of those things are going\nto be coming soon.&quot;\n\nThe door opened and light spilled into the room revealing that the\nSHARKTICONS had been knocked against the walls and five figures stood\nin the room all of them with MAXIMAL emblems, one of them was the\nLONGRACK who had been talking.\n\n&quot;If you want to live you will come with us.&quot; Said one of the other\nfigures, a shorter one with black and white armor who looked like his\nbeastmode was a penguin.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
