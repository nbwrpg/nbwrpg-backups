It looked like a dot to the\nnaked eye, but it was actually a stasis pod, containing a protoform and a\nspark.  The pod made a rough landing about ten miles from the lava zone.\nThe scanner activated and began scanning for compatable life forms.\n\nIt didn&#39;t find any.  The scanner tried again and again but it didn&#39;t find\nanything, not even a skeleton.  So, it resulted to an alternate method:\nGoing into its memory banks, it searched for records of animals relating to\nthe planet that the scanner thought it was on.  It finally found one and\nintegrated it into the protoform.\n\nThe pod door opened and a figure stepped out.  Then the figure sunk to his\nknees because the energon was getting to him.  He quickly transformed into\nbeast mode and went off to search for where he was.\n\nHe finally came upon a lake.  He looked at his reflection in the water.  He\nwas a white horse with a yellow horn on top.\n\n&quot;What am I?&quot;  He asked noone in particular.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Inferno731@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 14, 2000 9:38 PM\nSubject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n&gt; Out of the depths of the ship a figure walks up to Shuko and....\n&gt; Poisonbite: Luitentant Poisonbite reporting.
