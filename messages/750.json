She looked \nlongingly at the herd of deer across the field and her stomach growled \nagain, she sighed.*\n\n&quot; In a matter of fact, I am...a little.&quot;\n\n* She disliked being in robot mode for to long, it made her feel too \nunnatural for her taste. Zyber stood still...*\n\n&quot; Beast Mode!&quot;\n\n* Now transformed she sat on her haunches and curled her tail around her, \nshe sniffed the air as her stomach growled for the fourth time. The sent of \nthe deer was so inviting and she was so hungry, she looked towards them and \nfelt her mouth water.But she was in the company of another bot and it would \nbe impolite to just run off and bring down her prey. She sighed and looked \nback at Rowdy Wolf, it was much more important to speak with a bot then to \nfeed one&#39;s stomach.*\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
