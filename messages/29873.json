He silently hands it to \nMegatron. The cube would be enough to take Megatron out of serious \nenergy loss, but not nearly enough to power him to a point where he \ncould successfully fight.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Jeremiah &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Megatron is forced to sit now, his energon ever detiriorating. He \ncan\n&gt; almost taste the sweet feeling of his cells being powered up. He \nshould\n&gt; have recharged along time ago, he thinks to himself, making a \nmental note.\n\n\n"}}
