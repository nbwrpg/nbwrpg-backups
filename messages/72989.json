Yet, instead of\n&gt; charging in as the others would have thought he&#39;d do, Tucson remains put and\n&gt; in a train of quiet thought.  So much so that he gave such an emotionless\n&gt; gaze as if in deep meditation.  Yoketron had taught him not to act in\n&gt; complex situations but to think instead, of a way to cleverly get around a\n&gt; tough spot.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looks at the fungi growing in the cavern, and the stalagmites and\n&gt; stalactites and sniffs the moisture rich air around them.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Water.  It feeds the plants and ground even this far down.  Fire, as\n&gt; powerful as it is, it yet has one weakness.  And what gives life to the\n&gt; vegetation, brings death to the flames of fire.  And even more so of an\n&gt; enemy to flames is the cold earth that is beneath our feet.  But we haven&#39;t\n&gt; got time to dig, we need water and I sense it, all around us.  If we can\n&gt; access the water we can put out the fire.&quot;\n\nOOC: Smart move SANDY!!!!!!!!!\n\nLEO PRIME looked around, his shapr optics scanning the surrounding\nroom. &quot;I can smell it too. But where was it coming from?&quot;\n\n&quot;There.&quot; The voice was not that of one of the MAXIMALS it was CRYOTEK\nas he walked up and looked around. He was pointing at a small river of\nwater running along the center of the cavern. It was perhaps a foot of\nso wide, running right at the columb of fire but then cleverly\ndiverted to go around it by rocks and stone.\n\nLooking back to where the water has come from the remains of a tunnel\ncan be seen, but it has been dammed up by stone and even bits of\nmetal.\n\n&quot;What are they doing?&quot; TORCA said as he looked over at the group by\nOPTIMUS PRIME. MAGMATRON had approached the figure of OPTIMUS PRIME\nand was watching as cables were connected to him and then to OPTIMUS\nPRIME.\n\nSABERBACK was just watching MAGMATRON, his stance cold and brooding.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
