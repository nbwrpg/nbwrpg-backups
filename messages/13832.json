Thank you.&quot;  She kissed his cheek and turned to Phobia.\n\n&quot;Phobia, I need to ask you if we may have use of your ship.  Your \nship is powerfull enough to cripple the maximals in a major way.  \nWhen Megatron get&#39;s back, I want to be able to tell him that we may \ncount on you and your ship to get revenge on the maximals.  I..&quot;she \nlooked down.  &quot;I owe it to a friend.  I can hear her spark cring our \nfor revenge. I need to be able to crush them.  Please Phobia.&quot;\n\nShe closed her eyes and saw her shot strike Land Mine in the head and \ncause her death.  Her face showed pain and remorse and she relived \nthat moment when she took her friends life to save her from torture \nand more suffering.  She opened her eyes and looked at Phobia.  A \nsingle tear rolled down her cheek.  Her eyes begged for the use of \nthe ship.  \n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::DrillBit::\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your looking for Deemos?
