He fell asleep soon \n&gt; after.\n&gt; \n&gt; In his dreams, he met three bots.  The first was a big and tall \none, \n&gt; he had red eyes and a sinister laugh.  He laughed at Malice, until \n&gt; Malice curled up to cover his audios.\n&gt; \n&gt; The second was a femme, tall and slender.  She too laughed at him, \n&gt; and pointed and laughed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The third and final was also a femme.  But she was differant.  She \n&gt; was a little shorter than the previous, and kind.  She kneeled \ndown \n&gt; and tried to reach out to him.  He at first, moved away, but then, \n&gt; reached for her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Malice awoke several hours later, sitting up.  He was breathing \nhard, \n&gt; and it triggered a signal in Hellplague.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hellplague opened a channel to Malice, who ignored it for a moment.\n&gt; &quot;Yes, Master?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Are you alright?  My sensors in your body detected an emotional \n&gt; overload.  Ae you okay?&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, I am fine.&quot;\n&gt; Hellplague closed the channel, and laid back down.  She wondered \nif \n&gt; she should tell Blacknightmare.\n&gt; &quot;Blacknightmare,&quot; she said softly into her comm,&quot;Malice isn&#39;t \nfeeling \n&gt; good.  He had a dream or something, it really bothered him.  I \nworry, \n&gt; if it will afect his performance somehow.
