With a few \nhours, he was rested to better performance in battle and command, \nwhat ever shall turn. He stood up, and walked out from his quarters. \nHe went to the bridge to check who was there and if there was any \nthing there to do. Any commands or such. He looked around and walked \nto the command chair. He checked the monitors, each camera that was \nsuplied to the internal and external parts of the ship. After he saw \nnothing wrong, no signs of Megatron or Hell Beast, which he was \nlooking for, he turned away. \n\nFor a moment, he checked his shoulder. It wasn&#39;t in the best shape. \nHe managed to pop it back into place, but not very skillfully. He \nwould have to make a visit to the CR room later.\n\nHe exited the room to explore the cooridors again, to get the hang of \nthe vessle.\n\n\n"}}
