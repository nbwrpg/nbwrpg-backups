The pod sent out a\nsmall DNA scanner to scan for a suitable life form, as\nit was programmed to do. Moments later WindRider\nemerged from the pod. He took a moment to examine\nhimself. He had taken the form of a condor. &quot;Excellent\nform&quot;, he thought. &quot;This must be Earth.&quot; He had often\nread about Earth while studying the Great War between\nthe Autobots and Decepticons, and had always wanted to\ncome here, but not this way. Sighing, he decided he\nmay as well fly out and see what he could find.\n--- Terry Barlow &lt;twb176@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ::WindRider::\n&gt; WindRider loved his life. He had been serving aboard\n&gt; a\n&gt; Maximal science ship deployed to discover and\n&gt; explore\n&gt; new worlds for colonization. He loved science, and\n&gt; he\n&gt; loved finding out new things, so this was his dream\n&gt; assignment. Not long ago, their sensors detected an\n&gt; unexplained rift in space, and in the interest of\n&gt; science it was decided that a small one man craft\n&gt; would be sent out to explore the anomaly. After the\n&gt; craft was fitted with special scanners, he set out.\n&gt; He\n&gt; was checking his navigation computer when suddenly\n&gt; an\n&gt; alert sounded. There was a problem with the engine,\n&gt; and it overloaded. There was a pod for emergency\n&gt; escape in the back of the craft, and he hurriedly\n&gt; got\n&gt; out of his chair and ran to it. He got in. The pod\n&gt; launched just before the craft exploded into a ball\n&gt; of\n&gt; fire. Unknown to him, the pod drifted toward the\n&gt; anomaly.\n&gt; (I know this is kind of long. I hope this isnt\n&gt; considered moding!)\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
