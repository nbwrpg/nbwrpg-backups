The general agreement is that by the Beast Wars era TFs have evolved to the point where they can do this. They no longer need Vector Sigma to give life. It makes a lot of sense though. TFs have always been said to evolve, and they mimic humans in every other way. The only thing is that Airly had Nightlight actually give birth to the child. Most people speculate that TFs would merge their programming, or copies of their sparks when having sex. This creates a new spark for the child that is carried by the mother. Then a body is built to put the spark in, or a protoform can be used.\n CatMaster o &lt;catmastero@...&gt; wrote:--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Richard Allen &lt;roborick007@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Well Roddy and Nightlight did the bad *cough good cough* thing\nand ended up with this daughter.
