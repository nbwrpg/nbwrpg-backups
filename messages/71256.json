YOU ARE BACK!!! I MISSED YOU SOO MUCH!!&quot;said a childish voice,\n&gt; Nigh=\r\ntlight Huged tightly her daughter and and tears of happines started to appe=\r\nar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;My Elita... My sweet daughter...&quot;whispered Nighlight with a smile\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I was really Impattient to see you mom; I really... Really missed you&quot;=\r\n said\n&gt; ELita with a wide Smile &quot;But my dad and Perceptor...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;&quot;WHAT???=\r\n?&quot; said shocked Nighlight while she watched Rodimus\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Oppssi&quot; said Elita=\r\n while she lowed her ears\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nRODIMUS had been smiling broadly as ELITA=\r\n and NIGHTLIGHT were being\nreunited. He had even leaned back a little to al=\r\nlow the two to hug and\nshow affection. That is until ELITA=92s last stateme=\r\nnt and he could see\nthe look on NIGHTLIGHT=92s face.\n\nSmiling warmly and no=\r\ndding RODIMUS took NIGHTLIGHT=92s hand. =93Yes,\nPerceptor has been instrume=\r\nntal in your recovery.=94 Leaning back in he\ncontinued to smile at her, hop=\r\ning to wipe away her fears if he could.\n\n=93From what we can tell, Percepto=\r\nr has joined the Maximals.=94 RODIMUS\nrubbed ELITA=92s head giving her reas=\r\nsurance and affection as well.\n=93Just like our daughter here has said.=94\n=\r\n\n******************************************\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Perceptor walked c=\r\nlose to  Lord Elder and shook his head  and said &quot;It&#39;s\n&gt; highly unlikely th=\r\nat that happens &quot;\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Outside, Uproar catches up to Lord Elder, =\r\nas he observes the private code\n&gt; on  Tuscons door.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Wow, so, I guess =\r\nTucson and Talon are kinda gonna be like Rodimus and\n&gt; Nightlight.  I wonde=\r\nr if Tucson will ya know..  Have a family of his own\n&gt; some day?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nE=\r\nLDER looked away from the door, his optics reddening slightly. If he\nwere h=\r\numan it might even seem like a blush. =93Who can say Uproar, who\ncan say? I=\r\n would imagine that that is something that we may all want\nto do at some po=\r\nint.=94\n\nTORCA and NOCTORRO walked with ELDER as well, their large forms\nsw=\r\naying as they walked, the sound of their footsteps large and heavy\nas their=\r\n metal booted feet hit the deck plating.\n\n=93We still must talk.=94 TORCA s=\r\naid looking at ELDER, his tone somber and\nresigned. NOCTORRO was tapping ou=\r\nt a small message as they talked, but\nhe looked up and nodded in agreement =\r\nas well.\n\nELDER nodded as he glanced at TORCA and then at the others. =93Up=\r\nroar,\nwhy don=92t you show Perceptor around the base and help him get settl=\r\ned\nin, I would imagine he will need to find some quarters and perhaps a\nrec=\r\nharging chamber coded to his requirements.=94\n\n****************************=\r\n**************\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Moving to Legacy&#39;s quarters, Straight Shot thin=\r\nks for a moment before\n&gt; saying anything, which was her best of traits.  On=\r\nce she had an idea of\n&gt; what she wanted to say, she looks up to Legacy, wit=\r\nh an air of sincerity she\n&gt; always had for everyone, including her brother.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Thanks, for letting me talk to you, I appreciate it.  I just wanted =\r\nta let\n&gt; ya know that I think my brother doesn&#39;t quite understand where you=\r\n&#39;re\n&gt; coming from and maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s so critical of your actions.  H=\r\ne&#39;s\n&gt; always been like that, not just around you, but with me too, and yeah=\r\n,\n&gt; sometimes it gets on my nerves.  But with things as they are, and what\n=\r\n&gt; happened ta him in the past, I can kind of see why he&#39;s put up such a def=\r\nense\n&gt; and why he&#39;s so determined ta think off the pavement.  And maybe tha=\r\nt&#39;s why\n&gt; his personality clashes with yours.  It&#39;s clashed with mine too, =\r\nat times.\n&gt; Honestly though, how do you feel about his thinking outside the=\r\n box?  Is there\n&gt; a reason why you&#39;d rather not go that way?&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nFor a=\r\n moment LEGACY looked confused, his single crimson optic boring\ninto STRAIG=\r\nHT SHOT as his mind ran over what she said.\n\n=93I do not understand all of =\r\nthe colloquialisms than you have\nutilized.=94 He said at last, =93But I asc=\r\nertain that you are attempting\nto explain your sibling=92s actions to me an=\r\nd inquiring as to why I will\nnot allow Tuscon to disturb Optimus Prime=92s =\r\nchassis.=94\n\nLEGACY=92s optic flickered for a moment. =93I appreciate your =\r\nintent.=94 He\nsaid his words clear and well articulated. =93But I do not re=\r\nquire an\nexplanation, since I have taken no offense to his actions; to do s=\r\no\nwould be an inefficient use of my time.=94\n\n=93However to answer your que=\r\nstion I will replay something for you.=94\n\nTurning to the screen that was s=\r\ntanding behind LEGACY he fired a beam\nof energy at it. But instead of it ex=\r\nploding into shards of glass and\ndebris it simply changed to show a mountai=\r\nnous scene, a volcano, and\nthen the volcano exploding to reveal the Ark. It=\r\n was obvious from the\nmotion that the events were being speeded up for ease=\r\n of viewing.\n\nSoon after it happened a small satellite like device rose up =\r\nfrom the\nArk and began to travel away from it and after a while return. Aft=\r\ner\nanother short moment, short because of the speeded up play back,\nMEGATRO=\r\nN flew out along with STARSCREAM, SOUNDWAVE and a few other\nDecepticon seek=\r\ners, obviously having been repaired by the device. They\nall land on a cliff=\r\n and look back at the Ark, and STARSCREAM fires a\nblast at the Ark and they=\r\n all fly off.\n\nInside the Ark, because of the blast from STARSCREAM, OPTIMU=\r\nS PRIME is\nalso is knocked into the beam and his repair process begins.\n\n(O=\r\nOC: This is the scene from G1 Cartoon episode 1 after the bots and\ncons fel=\r\nl to earth and 4 million years had passed.)\n\nThe scene fades to black.\n\n=93=\r\nThese sequence of cannot be disrupted.=94 LEGACY intoned coldly.\n=93Without=\r\n the Autobots none of you would be here.=94 LEGACY turned back\nto face STRA=\r\nIGHT SHOT, =93And without the Decepticon=92s attack on the Ark\nthe Autobots=\r\n will not survive.=94\n\nLEGACY folded his arms behind his back, =93There can=\r\n be no disruption of\nthe time flow.=94\n\nThere was a small beep on LEGACY=92=\r\ns panel causing him to look over at\nit. =93Interesting.=94 He said curiousl=\r\ny. =93It would seem that I am\nrequired on the bridge.=94\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
