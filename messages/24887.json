She always won! He was the one who had \nall the classes and had actually trained for this! Why did she always beat \nhim so easily?! Rion tried to roll over, but just ended up with his wing in \na very uncomfortable position:\n\n&quot;C&#39;mon! You cheated!&quot;\n\nRion tried to scowl, but couldn&#39;t help laughing when Diana wiggled her toes \nagainst his chest. He was ticklish and she knew it! Finally she allowed him \nto get to his feet, well, first he wanted to sit there and look really \nsullen cause he lost. He toyed with the sand a bit before looking up at \nDiana:\n\n&quot;How&#39;d ya do that?&quot;\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
