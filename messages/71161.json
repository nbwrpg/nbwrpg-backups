I highly doubt Hy=\r\ndras is gonna be able ta stick all of his snouts in our business too easill=\r\ny after you do the upgrades.&quot;\n\nShe smiles as she watches Rodimus and Tucson=\r\n together, now sharing a moment of friendship as it should be amongst Autob=\r\not Commanders.\n\nTucson gives a casual smile to Rodimus. It was like old tim=\r\nes.  They had fought hard together before and now, with Rodimus back safely=\r\n he was assured that there would be nothing that would stand in the way of =\r\ntheir friendship.\n\n&quot; I want you to know that this time, Rodimus, I won&#39;t le=\r\nt anyone or anything stand in the way of our comradship.  I learned a great=\r\n deal the day I was taken off line.  I learned to watch my back at all time=\r\ns, and never to let my guard down.  So if anyone dares to cross our line ag=\r\nain, there will be a serious lesson to be learned.  But, that lesson is twi=\r\nce learned when it comes from two Primes instead of just one.  As soon as I=\r\n&#39;m fully operational, of course, I - think it would benefit all of us, if w=\r\ne had a more substantial base of operations.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot looks over to =\r\nthem.\n\n&quot;Heeey, sorta like Metroplex in the past..  Of course, there aren&#39;t =\r\nany transformers that size anymore huh?&quot;\n\nTucson nodds.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right.  Bu=\r\nt it doesn&#39;t mean it has to stop us from creating a base of operations.  I&#39;=\r\nd like to also preserve the land in it&#39;s purity.  Perhaps create something =\r\nthat intergrates with the environment. &quot;\n\nQuickstride listens in.\n\n&quot;Oh, sor=\r\nt of an organic base but sort of not.  Kind of.. Ya know, that might be doa=\r\nble.  Maximal bases are like that, and I&#39;m sure we can find materials for i=\r\nt without upsetting anything or anyone.  And we can always power the base w=\r\nith solar pannels, so that way we don&#39;t drain the planet of it&#39;s natural re=\r\nsources.  And if we need to create a fuel source, why not go botanical? Non=\r\n chemical means no pollution.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles.\n\n&quot; I like the sound of tha=\r\nt.  But first, I think we have more important issues to deal with.  Hydras.=\r\n.  For now, the Ark alone will have to do, but in time, we can think of exp=\r\nanding our base of operations, perhaps convert it to residential quarters, =\r\nwhere we can be assured safety.  Again, this will have to come in time.&quot;\n\nH=\r\ne staggers somewhat, and points to the CR Chambers.\n\n&quot; I - better not waste=\r\n any more time getting to the CR chambers.&quot;\n\nHe slowly makes his way over t=\r\no the CR chambers, and makes it to a large booth, where he sits down and th=\r\nen lies back.  With a sigh, it&#39;s not long before he goes into a sleep mode.=\r\n  At last, he listens to his systems and settles down for a much deserved r=\r\necharge.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson&#39;s grin grows.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot; Hmm, then I - su=\r\nppose as soon as I&#39;m well enough, we - should try\n&gt; &gt; and think ahead and -=\r\n hopefully plan our precautionary measures\n&gt; &gt; against =96 future attacks.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That made Straight Shot smile. She was happy to see Tucson comming=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; his senses.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rodimus put an arm around Tuscon, as mu=\r\nch to help him as it was to show\n&gt; friendship. &quot;Tuscon. You have done so mu=\r\nch and you have so much more to\n&gt; give. Go rest and we shall await your rec=\r\novery.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Smiling Rodimus continued, &quot;Besides I am sure the Predacons ar=\r\ne going to\n&gt; need time to recover before they try any more attacks. I don&#39;t=\r\n think they\n&gt; were looking any good as they took off.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;I&#39;m having one or two ideas to do that... Protect the Ark&quot;said dryly\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPerceptor&quot;but every one need to rest a while, cause the work, in case that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s done, is really heavy&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Legacy turned to look at Pe=\r\nrceptor, his single remorseless optic cold and\n&gt; speculative. &quot;I agree that=\r\n the Ark does require more security to protect it\n&gt; from future incursions.=\r\n However any security concerns have to be weighed\n&gt; against the possible ch=\r\nanges to the temporal continuum.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Folding his arms over his chest Lega=\r\ncy looked at Tuscon and Rodimus as well\n&gt; as Perceptor to be sure that each=\r\n got the point. &quot;Any changes we make to the\n&gt; Ark stand a chance of being s=\r\nignificant enough so as to change what should\n&gt; be.&quot; Legacy&#39;s optic darkens=\r\n, &quot;Changing that could have unanticipated results\n&gt; for us and anything tha=\r\nt would or should have come into contact with.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
