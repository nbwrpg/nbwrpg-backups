She couldn&#39;t believe her audio \nsensors. &quot;Really? I was serving them? How? I don&#39;t remember anything \nafter fighting them just outside the ark.&quot; She watched as Firearm \nwalked in carrying another bot and watches as he puts the bot in the \nCR chamber. Then it hit her as to what he said about Striker. Her \nspark jumped. She didn&#39;t want to lose him. &quot;What about Striker? \nWhat&#39;s happened? He&#39;s been reprogrammed? How? When did that happen?&quot; \nShe sat down in the chair next to the chamber with a look of shock on \nher face.  She couldn&#39;t remember what had happened and was scared and \nconfused.\n\nHer maximal program and trainer program were in conflict.  The minute \nthe trainer chip hit her, her maximal programs went into a sleeper \nmode.  In her maximal state, she wouldn&#39;t remember anything after the \nchip hit her.  But her Trainer state, lay dormant for the moment.  \nBut when it woke up, it would only have one thing that it wanted to \ndo, continue to serve Prebon.\n\nBut for now, she was in her maximal state. She was worried for her \nlove, Striker.  She looked up at Firearm and Smokescreen. &quot;Could you \nplease tell me what happened to Striker? And what happened to me?&quot; \nShe was on the verge of tears from fear and anger. More angry at \nherself for not knowing what had happened to her or Striker, but she \nhad the feeling she was involved in some way.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Smokescreen/Firearm::\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen nods. &quot;Its possible. The trainers hit you with a mind-\n&gt; controll chip. You have been serving them for a little while. \nRamulus \n&gt; made a counter chip, and shot it into you. It should have fried the \n&gt; Trainer one, but it might not have. They&#39;re all still at the \nbattle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks her over, &quot;We&#39;re going to have to get that chip out of \nyou. \n&gt; Do you mind coming with me to the Cybertronian Fire?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Smokescreen turns his head, the sound of footsteps announcing \n&gt; Firearm&#39;s arrival a few seconds before the Maximal walks in. \nFirearm \n&gt; walks over to the CR chamber and puts BlueStreak in.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The Trainers left,&quot; Firearm says to Smokescreen, glancing at \nSpears, \n&gt; &quot;Striker looks like he&#39;s been reprogrammed. He nearly killed \nRamulus, \n&gt; hit BlueStreak pretty hard, and killed a Maximal femm. The weapon \n&gt; Ramulus got us didn&#39;t do anything against him, so he isn&#39;t chipped. \n&gt; He left with the Trainers, so we didn&#39;t get him.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
