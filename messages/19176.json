She hooked up to the connection.  The \nprotoform started shaking on the table.  The optics flickered and \nchanged color.  Shadow Wing had finally found the connection that \nmade her apart of the form.  Her spark was taking control of the \nform.  She started to feel the body of the form and felt away of it&#39;s \nsurroundings.  The form stopped moving and lay still.  The form went \ninto a suspended animation mode.  Shadow Wing awoke, but the form was \nalseep.  She thought that she had to do something to communicate with \nVeratis.  Then she felt him, is thoughts.  She could hear his \nthoughts. She was scared but at the same time facinated by this.  She \nthought to him,&quot;Hey, can you hear me? I can hear you, kind of. What&#39;s \ngoing on? What happened?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
