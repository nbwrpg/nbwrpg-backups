Communicate with the Maximal leader. Have a private, no aid talk \nwith the leader about exchanging the hostages for something. Than he \ntakes the leader by surprise and insert the chip, giving Prebon rule \nof the Maximals! Yes, that would do greatly....\n\nThe others pulled Striker out of the CR Chamber.\n\n&quot;He&#39;ll wake up when he&#39;s ready. He&#39;s fixed enough for now.&quot;\n\nThey carried him down to the brig section, and placed him in a \nspecial cell. One of those with the big steel doors and only a little \neye panelt that can be moved on the outside. They escorted him in and \ncuffed his hands and feet to the wall. This bot was in for the worst \nexperience of his life.\n______________________________________________________________________\nStarscream\n\nStarscream followed Zardus, shaking his head. He could tell Zardus \ndidn&#39;t care about Megatron. But he would soon enough. He only hoped \nthat Phobia listened to his mutiny speech.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nBrix/Fliq\n\nBrix and Fliq did everything in their power to keep the ship steady.\n\n&quot;Come on Ramulus, we gotta hurry!&quot;\n\nThe descended more, not exacly falling, but not exactly peaceful \neither. They passed through all the clouds....and then it was there.\n\n&quot;The Ark.....and everybody&#39;s outside. All welcoming us.&quot;\n\n&quot;Maybe, or they had another battle. But we can fix The Ark now. One \nproblem.&quot;\n\n&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can land this baby. Ramulus, keep putting the fire \nout. I&#39;ll try my best.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
