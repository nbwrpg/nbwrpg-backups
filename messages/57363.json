He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt nostalgic, thinking of Pumpskin, who had fallen in the \nhands of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Preds, the Tripredacus, who had conquered his homeland, \nand\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Survivors, trying to build a semblant of resistance on Earth. \nHis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fists clenched and emotion swirled in his mind. He hated the\n&gt; Predacons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for their constant tugs on the Pax Cybertronia, but he was now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loathing against the Tripredacus.
