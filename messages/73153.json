Also the\nfact that TUSCON has already been damage=\r\nd once by trying to deflect\nhis plasma blast with his arm has helped immens=\r\nly.\n\nAgility takes power, that is a warrior&#39;s maxim. The heavier you are,\nt=\r\nhe more power it takes to propell yourself through the air. It\napplied to T=\r\nUSCON as much as it did to MAGMATRON. Although MAGMATRON\nwas signifigantly =\r\nheavier than TUSCON, TUSCON was not light weight\neither. He was built to be=\r\n a PRIME.\n\nIt was two dragons fighting each other, one nearly twice as larg=\r\ne as\nthe other, both skilled and full of their own anger and power! As much=\r\n\nas TUSCON was relying on agility and training, it was obvious to\nonlookers=\r\n that MAGMATRON was also well trained.\n\nA veteran of wars and battles that =\r\nTUSCON had only seen in historical\nvideo, MAGMATRON was also well versed in=\r\n many of the combat arts and a\nmaster of several!\n\nIn this draconic mode MA=\r\nGMATRON was like some chimeric dragon-like\ncreature, his powerful forearms =\r\nslashing out visciously at TUSCON,\nignoring the music and noise coming from=\r\n the others!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstride looks around and reloads his cannon.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well that worked but there&#39;s still a long way ta go.  Time ta reload =\r\nand\n&gt; keep shooting.  Sheesh, they even come outa the woodwork.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nTh=\r\ney had almost literally swarmed with SHARKTICONS, although their\nnumbers ha=\r\nd been thinned out by at least half! Many of them were\nbeginning to circle =\r\ntowards the center of the cavern again as they\nregrouped around SKY BYTE an=\r\nd the others.\n\nAs QUICKSTRIDE was reloading several SHARKTICONS came at him=\r\n at once\ntrying to catch him while he was distracted. The attack was not al=\r\nl\nthat clever, but it did show a level of intellegence and grasp of the\nsit=\r\nuation that the SHARKTICONS of old may not have grasped. However\nthese new =\r\nones seemed to be a bit more astute, even with their master\nunder attack an=\r\nd not able to give them more direct orders.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; DINOBOT&#39;s shot ove=\r\nr was pure luck rather than skill, but he would take what\n&gt; he could get as=\r\n his large tail blaster glowed, him trying to use it in close\n&gt; quarters to=\r\n slash off the SHARKTICONS around and try to regain some room!\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n There was a groan from VICE GRIP.  Saved by MAXIMALS.  What was prehistori=\r\nc\n&gt; Earth coming to?  He took the opportunity to throw off some of the\n&gt; SH=\r\nARKTICONS on top of him, getting up, his body sparking and heavily\n&gt; damage=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; Right in time to be sent sprawling by the shockwave from the thrown\n=\r\n&gt; explosive!\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nWith the work of DINOBOT and the MAXIMAL FUZORS as wel=\r\nl as RAT TRAP\nand QUICKSTRIDE the SHARKTICONS were nearly spent!\n\nExcept fo=\r\nr the few still attacking QUICKSTRIDE most of them had\nclustered around SKY=\r\nBYTE, there were perhaps 20 of them left as oppose\nto the horde of them see=\r\nmed to almost boil into the room a few minutes\nago . . .\n\n. . . could it re=\r\nally have been so short of a time span? . . .\n\nSKYBYTE&#39;s smile had little h=\r\numor in it as he watched the scene.\nInstead it had hints of fear and, a los=\r\ns of the supreme confidence\nthat he once had. His optics glanced across the=\r\n SHARKTICON carcasses\nthat littered the floor.\n\n=93ATTACK!!!=94 He yelled o=\r\nut, forgetting about the poetry and the finesse\nof it all, and with that si=\r\nngle word SKYBYTE sent his last remaining\nSHARKTICONS into battle! Meanwhil=\r\ne he himself began back peddling\ntowards MAGMATRON was battling TUSCON.\n\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;RODIMUS!!! WATCH OUT!!!&quot; screamed Nightlight at her real husband=\r\n, in spite\n&gt; of her pain, she slowly crawled towards the both Rodimus. Stop=\r\nping every\n&gt; time more flecuantly because her lack aenergy\n\n=93No!=94 LEO P=\r\nRIME barked out as he and BIG CONVOY leaped at the pit and\nthe bridge that =\r\nspanned it. That had been caught in battle with the\ndraconish soldiers that=\r\n had come out!\n\nLEO and CONVOY had both just worked their way over it when =\r\nthey also\nheard the warning from NIGHTLIGHT!\n\nHOWEVER at the same time CRYO=\r\nTEK, who had just recovered, also was\nflying towards them, his wings outstr=\r\netched, his jaws opened wide!\n\nTORCA was converging on the spot, leaping up=\r\n over the large stone that\nhad covered SABERBACK to leap over to try to per=\r\nhaps catch the falling\nOPTIMUS!\n\nAt the last moment DARK RODIMUS and RODIMU=\r\nS PRIME, as if finally\nrealizing that all the commotion was centered over t=\r\nheir heads looked\nup . . .\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;CRACKTHOOM!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;BOOM!&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;BOOM!&lt;&lt;   &gt;=\r\n&gt;THOOM!&lt;&lt;\n\n. . . explosions that sent nearly all of them reeling!\n\nLEO PRIM=\r\nE, BIG CONVOY, TORCA and CRYOTEK went sent spinning through the air!\n\nThe b=\r\nlackened version of OPTIMUS PRIME hit the bridge, sending RODIMUS\nand DARK =\r\nRODIMUS sprawling to the ground! OPTIMUS=92 cannon smoking from\nthe firepow=\r\ner that he had just unleashed!\n\nHe had actually attacked PREDACONS and MAXI=\r\nMALS!\n\nOPTIMUS reached down and picked up DARK RODIMUS by the throat and\nlo=\r\noked at him and smiled.\n\n=93Optimus no.=94 RODIMUS PRIME said from the grou=\r\nnd as he looked up.\n\nOPTIMUS frowned as he looked down at RODIMUS PRIME, =\r\n=93Don=92t call me\nthat!=92 He said as he kicked RODIMUS and sent him spill=\r\ning over the\nside of the bridge.\n\nRODIMUS PRIME was only able to stop himse=\r\nlf from tumbling into the pit\nby a precarious handgrip on the side of the b=\r\nridge!\n\n=93Then what should we call you?=94 This was the voice of SKY SHADO=\r\nW as he\nlanded in front of the pit along with his FUZORS.\n\nThe figure that =\r\nwas once OPTIMUS PRIME, the blackened figure that had\nbeen bathed in the da=\r\nrk fires of UNICRONIAN energies looked down at\nthe FUZORS and then the rest=\r\n of the battlefield as a wicked grin\nspread across his face, =93You can cal=\r\nl me NEMESIS PRIME!=94\n\n&quot;But for those who wish to live, you can simply cal=\r\nl me MASTER!&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
