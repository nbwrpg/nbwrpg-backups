Ironhide turns his head to his side, and looks down, to see\n&gt; the centre of the disturbance. One very large Autobot had already\n&gt; smashed his desk, and was standing at his full height, very upset.\n&gt; Ironhide knew he was in for trouble, &quot;Is there a problem Grimlock?&quot; He\n&gt; asked, knowing there is. &quot;YES THERE PROBLEM&quot; Grimlock yelled, his\n&gt; voice echoing very clearly throughout all of Iocon. &quot;THIS BULLSHIT.\n&gt; YOU SEND ROOKIES TO FIGHT IN WAR THAT AFFECT WHOLE GALAXY, EVEN WHOLE\n&gt; TIME. YOU SEND A PACIFIST!!&quot; he declared in rage, as he pointed a\n&gt; finger at Pacifix. He pulled out his energon sword, and in one swipe,\n&gt; cleaved his whole rows podium straight in half. Grimlock stopped and\n&gt; looked up at the main council, his sword at his side, energy\n&gt; shimmering off it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ironhide sighed, how did he get a weapon in this room. This wasnt the\n&gt; first time this happened. &quot;Grimlock, you know that if one of us goes\n&gt; the Predacons will be on to us,&quot; He said calmly. &quot;None of us can go&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Grimlock looked back up, then crossed his arms, his sword just above\n&gt; his head, still shimmering, the energy intesifing the look of rage in\n&gt; his crimson eyes. &quot;Then I go to earth to&quot; he said quietly, and he was\n&gt; almost not heard with the large amount of gasps that escaped around\n&gt; the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
