I updated everything and put in a\nscript for the members page to be automatically generated and for the\ncharacters page to be easier updated by me. The Login is pretty much\nthe same for now, I&#39;m going to conver the chat room to a user-specific\none for the login tomorrow.\n\nSo everyone who didn&#39;t put up their chars yet, do so! The faster we\nget all our chars up, the faster we can start electing the new council.\n\nI&#39;m going to sleep. Now that most of the programming is behind me,\nI&#39;ll be RPGing more often. Thanx for your patience through all this, guys.\n\n\n"}}
