We&#39;ve \nlost to many people.  We want to know what the slag happened to the \nCybertronian Fire and Commander Kluster.  Groove, keep scanning.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Groove replied.\n\nHot Spot looked to the four other Protectobots, and the five other Maximals \non the bridge.  \n\n&quot;Hot Spot!  There&#39;s something closing in!&quot;\n\n&quot;Hail them.&quot;\n\n&quot;No response.&quot;\n\n&quot;Streetwise, open fire on them.  They obviously aren&#39;t going to attack.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t see it...and scanners can&#39;t pinpoint its location.&quot;\n\n&quot;Slag it!  Earth is only a little ways away, go at full speed for it.  Keep \nan eye out for any tricks.&quot;\n\n===\n\nFirestarter sat in the only seat of the Decepticon Talon-Class fighter.  Its \nhull resisted most scanners, and its weapons and shields were suburb, mixed \nwith millions of years of Autobot and Decepticon technology.\n\n&quot;Prepare to die, Autobots.&quot; He pressed a button, three laser bolts launching \nout of the tip of the talon shaped fighter.\n\n===\n\nFirst Aid slammed to the ground as the blasts somehow penetrated the Maximal \nshields surrounding the Dimentia, and cut through the hull.\n\n&quot;Hot Spot!  Hull breaches on all five levels!  Engine room reports we&#39;ve lost \ntranswarp power, as well as interstellar travel.  Weapons are out.&quot;\n\n&quot;SLAG!  Get to the esccape pods!  Launch the stasis pods!  Hurry, before that \nship makes another pass!&quot;\n\nHot Spot jumped out his command chair and left the bridge, followed by \nGroove, Blades, Streetwise, and First Aid.  They went to the left, while the \nfive other Maxis following them went to the right.\n\nThey reached the escape pods, and the hatch opened, the five Maximals \ncramming into a small space made for only three Maximals.\n\nThe pod launched, heading for Earth.\n\n\n===\n\nFirestarter saw six escape pods, and flaming battlecruiser.  He launched off \ntwo plasma missiles, laughing as the battlecruiser blew apart.\n\n&quot;Foolish Maximals...&quot; he chuckled.  Maybe if they had gotten off a barrage of \nmissiles and lasers, they could&#39;ve survived.  But they didn&#39;t.  Firestarter \nwatched as three escape pods were blown apart by the explosion, one was sent \nhurtling towards the moon, and two were heading for Earth.\n\nHe watched fifteen escape pods blow up, only three remaining, heading for \nEarth.\n\n&quot;No so fast...&quot; he laughed, sending his ship straight for the stasis pods, \nand activating activating a tractor beam.\n\n&quot;Unitron and Shockwave, you better be ready, because here I come.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n"}}
