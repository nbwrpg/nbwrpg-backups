It showed her fighting with Aracnia&#39;s group.  \nThen he saw her when she dies and was broght back from the matrix.  \nhe saw how the energon in her mech fluid made her heal from her \nwounds at a super fast rate.  He saw her when she fled Aracnia&#39;s \ngroup and when she was in the forest for a while.  He saw how inferno \njust flew up to her and told her how Megatron was dead and then the \nattack on her and inferno.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, kinger01030@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Destructor nodded &quot;I see but I have a much easier way.
