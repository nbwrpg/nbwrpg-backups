He opens his mouth to say something, \ninterrupted by a transmission. He looks down at his wrist comp, his \neyes widening slightly. Ominous Prime! Ominous had been one of the \noriginal supporters of the Alliance, and a great ally as well as a \nstrong adversary afterward. And now, the Energonian wanted to talk.\n\nZardus smiles to himself. This could really come out well. &quot;I&#39;m \nafraid I can&#39;t accompany you to your base right now. I have a very \nimportant meeting, with an .. old friend.&quot;\n\nDevilDuer walks into the bridge, looking at Zardus.\n\n&quot;Devil, go to the entrance to the Iron Fist. When Ominous arrives, \nescort him to the conference room,&quot; Zardus says. DevilDuer nods and \nwalks out of one of the doors, exiting the Iron Fist.\n\nWhile Zardus was relaying orders to DevilDuer, his comm was sending a \nreply to Ominous Prime. &quot;Ominous, this is Zardus. I must admit I \ndidn&#39;t expect to hear from you again. One of my soldiers will be \nwaiting at the entrance to my base. He&#39;ll lead you to the conference \nroom.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     &quot;How is the energon supply?&quot; Demanded Subcommander Putnam. He \nheld an \n&gt; inventory list and looked at Odiphious, the one who was responsible \nfor the \n&gt; upkeep of the energon.\n&gt;     He replied, &quot;We have met the week&#39;s quota. Why? We have enough \nenergy.&quot; \n&gt; HE asked, not knowing what Ominous was up too.\n&gt;     Putname smiled. &quot;The Commander has something planned for all of \nit. \n&gt; Something big. I dont know what it is, but whoever its for is going \nto be \n&gt; sorry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Ominous was on level one, better known as the Facility. In this \nlevel of \n&gt; the Orb were the many labs for Liquid Energon. Also, all the mining \ndeposits \n&gt; ended up in the holding tanks on this level.\n&gt;     &quot;Akron, get ready, the Fuz is powerful.&quot; He said. They were in \nthe middle \n&gt; of the Liquid Energon process. Fuzzing it into Liquid was \ndangerous, and a \n&gt; back lash occasionally happened.\n&gt;     As the energon slowly melted from the radiation, it released a \nfantastic \n&gt; blue fume. It was a beautiful glow, almost heavenly. And the thing \nOminous \n&gt; wanted more than ever. It was the very unstable Energon gas. \nUnfortunetly, it \n&gt; dissolved within minutes. He couldnt figure out how to keep it from \nfadding \n&gt; away.\n&gt;     &quot;So, what are you planning to do with all this energon boss?&quot; \nShe asked, \n&gt; through pink optics.\n&gt;     Ominous gave a sinister smile, but then agian, all of his \nsmiles were \n&gt; sinister. &quot;I have a plan. ALl will be reveiled soon Akron. But, You \nand I \n&gt; need to go and have a talk with an old associate of mine.&quot;\n&gt;     Akron looked forward to getting out of the Orb. &quot;And who would \nthat be?&quot; \n&gt;     Ominous paused. The name of this person was a powerful one, one \nthat held \n&gt; much respect, and fear, around here. &quot;Allience Commander Zardus. \nHe&#39;s our \n&gt; ticket to domination.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;I thought you wanted to destroy all Transformers!&quot; She said, a \ntone of \n&gt; anger in her sweet voice. &quot;Why would we make a pact with them?&quot;\n&gt;     Ominous, &quot;Because Akron, the Allience is powerful, very much \nso. With \n&gt; thier help we could do some major killing. And then of course we \nwould \n&gt; convert them into Energonians.&quot;\n&gt;     She still didnt like the idea, but nodded like a good soldier.\n&gt;     &quot;Besides, with what Im cooking up, I doubt any non-Energonian \nwould \n&gt; survive. He, and his minions, wont have much or a choice.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     They departed the Orb, and Madagascar completely. Headed towrds \nthe \n&gt; Allience HQ in a simple two person transport. Ominous was never one \nfor \n&gt; walking, and now that he had his very own Energonian Vessle, with \nall sorts \n&gt; of toys, he was going to use them.\n&gt;     Tapping the communication panle, he spoke. &quot;Zardus, or any \nranking \n&gt; Allience Member, this is Commander Ominous Prime of the Energonian \nEmpire. I \n&gt; wish to hold an audience with Zardus. I am an hours journey from \nyour \n&gt; location. Please respond soon.&quot;\n&gt;     &quot;Do you think they will listen to what we have to say?&quot; Akron \nasked from \n&gt; the seat directly behinde him in the small cockpit.\n&gt;     Ominous turned his silver head a bit, &quot;They&#39;ll listen. I know \nZardus, and \n&gt; he knows when an oppertunity comes his way. We wont be turned away.&quot;\n&gt;     The small transport sped onward, over the blue ocean with white \ncapped \n&gt; waves and the occasional dolphin leaping up to greet them.\n\n\n"}}
