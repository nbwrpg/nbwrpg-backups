This was pissing him off. Activating \nthe comm, one more time, he sends a transmission to ALL MAXIMALS.\n\n&quot;All Maximals, this is the third call to the meeting at the \nCybertronian Fire. Get to the conference room immediately.&quot;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nProwl glances at Iron Raptor as he hears her thoughts. He didn&#39;t mean \nto imply that she was weak by protecting her.\n\n-I didn&#39;t say you were weak, love- he replies through thought, \nlooking over at her as she stepped up. His eyes slid over her form, \nher curves showing through nicely. Prowl jerks his eyes back to \nshadown, but then frowns as he hears Iron Raptor&#39;s thoughts. The \nmixed beast mode wasn&#39;t gone?\n\nIris had said that the merge would take care of the problem. But what \nif it hadn&#39;t? What if Iron Raptor could still get stuck in that form? \nProwl shakes his head. It wasn&#39;t very likely. It was only a thought, \nafter all.\n\nHe looks back at Iron Raptor as she yells the command, watching her \ngo into the &#39;battle mode&#39;, or at least that&#39;s what he thought it was. \nHe smiles as he looks her over. Her curves still showed through. She \nlooked like a warrior now that she stood as tall as Prowl, but she \nwas still definetly feminine. Prowl smiles. He wouldn&#39;t mind finding \nout how it felt to kiss her in that mode...\n\nKluster&#39;s transmission sounds in Prowl&#39;s head, distracting him from \nIron Raptor&#39;s words to Shadow. This mode obvioustly had a comm-link.\n\n-Kluster&#39;s calling all Maximals to a meeting, love- he says to her \nusing his thoughts -We should get over to the Cybertronian Fire-\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, &quot;Megan Solmonson&quot; &lt;tmrattrap@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * Iron Raptor snappes her head towards the new voice just as Prowl \nfrowns, \n&gt; not seeing the bot right away but making sense of what feeling she \nwas \n&gt; recieving from Prowls mind, only amplafying it with her own senses.\n&gt; But where Prowl thought that this bot was not friendly, she left \nroom for \n&gt; the slight chance that he just might be. But that was the way she \nhad always \n&gt; thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; But then her eyes turned to Prowl just as some idea poped into his \nhead, \n&gt; reading or more like FEELING the words with which to speak before \nthey \n&gt; emerged out of his mouth.\n&gt; Forgetting about the heavy wings at her back.\n&gt; Though, watching and feeling in wonder as she watched the results \nof that \n&gt; one word.\n&gt; It was a battle mode!!\n&gt; Only with a new command and new results!!\n&gt; Iron Raptor watched as armor split to be replaced by another coat \nof it, \n&gt; only silver and by the sense of it...far more stronger.\n&gt; It even went beyond the limits of Transmetal 2s!\n&gt; Wow!\n&gt; \n&gt; But once the transformation was through and the newly armored Prowl \nstood \n&gt; between her and the new visitor her mind had only one thing to \nthink of at \n&gt; that moment, and her thoughts were directed right towards Prowl.**\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt; Oh no you don&#39;t! I can protect myself! What sort of weakling do \nyou think \n&gt; I am?!&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; * And with that she stepped towards the new bot, thanking tha \nMatrix above \n&gt; that her hair covered her, still, naked form. But not for long.\n&gt; Basically the same thing had happened to Prowl as had happened to \nher, they \n&gt; had both fused and her scanners indicated that she was now...part \nsnow owl. \n&gt; That was where the wings had come from.\n&gt; So, not that Prowl and herself were fused physically and mentally, \nsharing \n&gt; everything, then the only conclusion was that she would have \nsomething \n&gt; towards a similar battle mode...and perhaps the same baqttle \nactivation \n&gt; code.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor stood ready, her crystal blue eyes fixed on the new \nbot, knowing \n&gt; for a fact that he had no chance against just one of them.\n&gt; But there was also something in the back of her mind, something \nthat was \n&gt; trying to get out. A thought suddenly entering her mind.\n&gt; What had really happened about that nightmarish beast mode? Had it \nbeen \n&gt; wiped out completely? Or simply deactivated?\n&gt; Iron Raptor focused on that tingling in the back of her mind, \nsuddenly \n&gt; seeing something that almost made her jump back.\n&gt; It was there! It was still there! She could see it in her mind.\n&gt; On all fours, acidic saliva dripping from it&#39;s bared fangs as it \nhunched its \n&gt; soulder. Black exo-armor covering it&#39;s body, shining in some inner \nlight. \n&gt; Eyes trained forward...almost as it just like...hers....\n&gt; Iron Raptors eyes grew big; it was...under controle? No! \nWaiting...waiting \n&gt; to break free? No...ready to pounce? Yes! Ready for action! \n&gt; Just...like...HER! It was listening! Actually listening!\n&gt; The image in her mind then pawed the black ground...suddenly \n&gt; feeling...seeing it&#39;s toughts!\n&gt; Blood, carnage...death! Mutilation!!\n&gt; That&#39;s all she could feel from it!\n&gt; No...it wasn&#39;t really under controle...just not wanting to fight \nright now.\n&gt; But Iron Raptor then shook her head a bit, suddenly knowing that it \nwanted. \n&gt; For her to transform and at least release a bit of it, to fight.\n&gt; Well, the first request she could do!\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor then stepped in front of Prowl, the wind picking up and \n&gt; fluttering her hair a little, but not enough to show anything.\n&gt; She took in a deep breath, closing her optics for a moment and \nfinding her \n&gt; still point, all going dark around her other then the wind and the \nsound of \n&gt; her own sparkbeat. Concintrating on that beat she opened her eyes, \ngaze \n&gt; straight.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Iron Raptor, ULATRMETAL!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * With that she moved to her toes and whirled in a full circle, her \nmine and \n&gt; thus her eyes seeing nothing but blackness at first but then a \nlight \n&gt; surrounding her.\n&gt; Her hair seeming to sparkle as it flowed around her as she moved, \nher wings \n&gt; stretching wide before suddenly seeming to bust out as small \nsparkling \n&gt; snow-flakes.\n&gt; From the center of her back then seemed to sprout out of her flesh \ntwo \n&gt; pieces of fluid black armor, so dark that even the light seemed to \nbe drawn \n&gt; into them.\n&gt; Those two pieces appeared just under her arms and stretched to her \nwaist as \n&gt; Iron Raptor lifted her arms over her head, snapping her head \ntowards her \n&gt; upraised hands as the pieces then wrapped and molded themselves \naround her \n&gt; chest, slamming together at the center of her torso.\n&gt; Then, just as suddenly as before, two pieces of armor sprouted from \nthe \n&gt; small of her back this time, coming around to mold themselves to \nher pelvice \n&gt; and thighs. Slamming together with a metallic ring at her groin and \nfront \n&gt; thighs.\n&gt; Same with her lower legs, another metallic ring sent clear through \nthe \n&gt; darkness as, they too, came together.\n&gt; Iron Raptor finally lowered her arms, her eyes closed as her head \nbecame \n&gt; straight, armor also covering her arms up to her wrists, ending in \na point \n&gt; above her hand.\n&gt; Suddenly two large shoulder-plates appeared begind her, slamming \ndown on her \n&gt; soulders, the tips reaching even toller then her head. Two large \ndiamond \n&gt; shaped rubies in the center of each.\n&gt; From there a line of spiked armor as thin as a belt wrapped around \nher \n&gt; waist, a large piece of armor suddenlu developing and closing the \nbetl as it \n&gt; fell over her groin area.\n&gt; Iron Raptor then opened her eyes as, in a flash of red, a large and \nlong \n&gt; cape fell down towards her heals from the back of each shoulder-\nplate. Armor \n&gt; then coming from the back of her heals and extending down, covering \nher feet \n&gt; and ending in long sharp, silver raptor claws. The armor so long \nwhat it \n&gt; looked as if she stood on her tip-toes, yet only raising her height \na few \n&gt; inches. Only looking like a pair of TMed raptor feet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptors mind then suddenly cleared in a flash, the blue \nmorning sky \n&gt; coming into view, a flock of large crows liting into the air as her \neyes \n&gt; then turned on the new bot, Shadow.\n&gt; Gazing towards him in her new armor, her body looking as if more \nlike a \n&gt; knight then Prowl. ( for anyone who&#39;s seen the anime Escaflowne, \nher armor \n&gt; is a bit like that. hehehe. If you don&#39;t know what Escaflowne is \nthen just \n&gt; fo to Ask Jeeves and type in Where can I find pictures of \nEscaflowne, and \n&gt; just look around on the sides that come up. The pica are really \ncool!)\n&gt; But she stood squarly, her body looking muck more bulkyier then \nbefore, but \n&gt; her head remained the same. Silver hair still falling loose from \nher head \n&gt; but now behind her back.\n&gt; Her face calm as she stood beside Prowl, now the same size as him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Iron Raptor  looked at Shadow, stepping towards him, the sound of \ngears \n&gt; moving and hydrolics working sounding out.*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Pay no attention to him.... As commander of the Maximals, I ask \nwho you \n&gt; are any why you threaten us so?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I will post IRs weapons as I use her more.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________________________________________________________\n_______________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
