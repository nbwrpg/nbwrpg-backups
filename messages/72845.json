YOu have other whelps with you.&quot;  Hissing\n&gt; over and holding his arms up in front of him, his weapons charged but not\n&gt; shooting at them.\n\n&gt; &lt;OLD - TUSCON&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Tucson continues to watch Drill Bit carefully. He also knew that his dragon\n&gt; mode was a little bit more suited for dealing with strangers since it was easy\n&gt; to ward them off as a large predator. He makes the transformation as silently\n&gt; as possible and then remains hidden, but with a little bit of a rumbling growl\n&gt; to his voice. It would be just enough to make himself heard and determined\n&gt; as an apex predator who is not to be toiled with.\n\n&gt; &lt;NEW - VICE GRIP&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For the moment, VICE GRIP stayed behind over DRILL BIT as the Bugacon\n&gt; popped out into the cavern, and remained relatively stealthed behind them,\n&gt; but at the close range in the tunnels he was fairly easy to spot on, as well\n&gt; as his noted staying back and away, nots peaking.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs the CYBERTRONIAN version of Mexican stand off was in the making BIG\nCONVOY, BREAK and MACH KICK came around the bend to take in the scene,\nthe sound of charged weapons filling the air for a moment.\n\n&quot;Yes there are other Maximals with him.&quot; BIG CONVOY said evenly as he\ncame to face the new comers to the group.&quot;\n\nBREAK chuckled, &quot;The question is, who are you, and should we blast ya or what?&quot;\n\nMACH KICK just chuckled as he looked between TUSCON and BIG CONVOY\nready to back either one of them up should things turn nasty.\n\nBIG CONVOY shook his head slightly in negation, &quot;What are the\nPredacons doing in here, looking to work with Magmatron? Doing his\nbidding?&quot;\n\nIt was always known that despite his fierce streak of independence\nMAGMATRON was a Predacon at heart and some believed that he got his\nstart among the DECEPTICON ranks in the days long before the peace\naccord working for the original MEGATRON.\n\nHe had definitely spent some time working with this MEGATRON, but that\nwas long before the PREDACONS and MAXIMALS had actually come to the\nEARTH itself.\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
