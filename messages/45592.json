But he looks just like me if \nthat \n&gt;   helps you.  And believe me he&#39;s done things that make the great \nwars \n&gt;   look like a battle with squirt guns.  Things Megatron himself \nwouldn&#39;t \n&gt;   do without a MUCH better reason than he had.\n&gt; \n&gt;   OOC:  Don&#39;t bots usually change there names depending on there \nBeast \n&gt;   Modes?\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;Jonathan&quot; &lt;jhogan@r...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; TT: remember that, and DON&#39;T mention it again.\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; {Panthos}\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;     The panther turned his head looking back at the maximal and \n&gt;   shrugged, &quot;Maybe he&#39;s undercover. Sounds like something a maximal \n&gt;   would do to infiltrate a predacon group. Do something slightly \nevil \n&gt;   and against your original nature, get sent to prison and get \nbusted \n&gt;   out for your knowledge.&quot;\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt;     Shaking his head, &quot;Then again maybe he really did turn to \nour \n&gt;   side.
