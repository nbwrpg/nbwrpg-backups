His vision slowly moved into focus, and he was\n  sur=\r\nprised to find that all his systems were functioning.\n\n  &quot;Well that&#39;s a fir=\r\nst!&quot; he said to himself, &quot;Usually when I blank out,\n  about half a dozen sy=\r\nstems are in dire need of repair.  Last thing I\n  remember, I was playing d=\r\narts with that Rattrap guy, and those other\n  people that were trying to ge=\r\nt me to be sociable.  Great....&quot;\n\n  He looked around, but didn&#39;t reconise a=\r\nny of his surroundings.  He\n  began to wander aimlessly, flying and landing=\r\n like he usually did\n  (since he wasn&#39;t equipped to fly for longer than 20 =\r\nseconds at a\n  time).  Hopefully he could find somewhere that had a repair =\r\nfacility\n  so that he could get to work on his long-damaged internal circui=\r\nts.\n\n  OOC: Feel free to have one of the Bushido&#39;s find me, or you can just=\r\n\n  let me wander and tell me what sort of area I am in.\n\n\n-----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n  YAHOO!
