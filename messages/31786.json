It is now only a \nmatter of downloading their consciousness into these shells.  Then we will \nuse the memories of Unitron and Firestarter to recreat their own so we don&#39;t \nhave to explain as much.  This will take thirty cycles or so.&quot; Vehement said, \nlooking to Shockwave as if he were an insect.\n\n&quot;Excellent.&quot; was Shockwave&#39;s reply.  \n\n&quot;Also,&quot; Sun Crusher added, &quot;there is something you will most likely want.&quot; \nSun Crusher walked over to the Guardian and its golden hue of a tendril \nwrapped around Sun Crusher&#39;s head, and a few cycles later Sun Crusher turned \nto the Emperor, handing out a disk.\n\n&quot;This, Emperor,&quot; he said mockingly, &quot;are tech specs of the original Megatron, \nyour ancient master.  Our Lord Unicron copied his tech specs before \nreformatting him into the imbecile that was Galvatron.  According to Unicron, \nMegatron may be here with followers, but we can&#39;t be sure.

Although the Brotherhood \nhad helped the Neo Decepticon greatly, he didn&#39;t see why Unitron would&#39;ve \nallied with Unicron, the being who was undoubtedly responsible for the fall \nof the Decepticon Empire, who was also the being responsible for his death.  \nIn Shockwave&#39;s mind.\n\n"}}
