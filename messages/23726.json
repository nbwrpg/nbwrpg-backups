It would be very helpful, just this once.\n\n* Iron Raptor smiled at Snow Techï¿½s little joke, glancing up at Prowl to see \nif he got it, even though it was about him.\nBut her eyes didn&#39;t stay on Prowl long enough to see his reaction before her \nattantion was drawn to Shadow Cat and her question. Glad to hear that they \nwere able to get back to base together.\nIron Raptor was just about to answer when she saw all three bots before her \nstiffen and look as if they had just seen a ghost. Then everything seemed to \nhappen at once, nearly making Iron Raptor jump in Prowl&#39;s arms.\nGo?\nBoth Snow Tech and Shadow Cat were screaming for Prowl and herself to leave, \nfinding herself looking down at the little ball of whimpering fur.\nThey were all freaked about something.\nBut then Iron Raptor heard something, far off and distant, crashing?\nSnapping her head towards the direction of the sound and bringing up a scan \nof the area she finally located a group of monsterous machines headed there \nway. Remaining calm while her freinds remained static and bugged out behind \nher.\nIron Raptor stepped out of Prowls arms, her head still facing the direction \nof the appraoching mobb. But then she turned and looked at ShadowCat.*\n\n&quot; Who are they?&quot;\n\n* Then turning her head towards the machines again, Iron Raptor stood \nbroadly and squared her shoulders...recieving Klusters transmission and \nProwls imput on an Alliance attack.\nGrowling at Prowl&#39;s slightly paniced tone.*\n\n&quot; The Cybertronian Fire will stand up to their attacks at least until we get \nthere.&quot;\n\n* Her voice was stearn and one that was not to be argued with.\nThe approaching creatures would have to wait indeed.\nIron Raptor turned towards her friends, determination in her mind. &lt; I don&#39;t \nknow what&#39;s going on here but none of us are going to stick around to find \nout.&gt; she thought to Prowl before pointing a finger towards her panicing \nfriends.*\n\n&quot; Shadow Cat, get ahold of yourself and fly Snow Tech and the little one out \nof here. The directions of 65.7346. There you&#39;ll find the Cybertronian Fire. \nBut watch it! The enemy could be there already. Arm your weapons and fight \nalongside the Maximals if the battle has started already. Prowl and I will \nbe right behind you.\nNow, GO!&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then looked towards Prowl.*\n\n&quot; Fore safety, you and I aren&#39;t going to leave the ground until I know they \nthese three are safely in the air and away from those...things. Then we&#39;ll \nfollow them.&quot;\n\n* Her eyes remained on Prowl as she continued the conversation in her mind.*\n&lt; There has to be something deep going on here for them to be like this. And \nas soon as everything is cleared up with the Alliance I want to get to the \nbottom of this.&gt;\n* From there, she waited for her friends to lead the way home.\nIron Raptor growled.*\n&lt; Out of the cooking pot and right into the fire....&gt;\n* The battle with the Alliance wouldn&#39;t be easy, but it gave them a chance \nto use their new bodies, and maybe get to controle them a little batter. Who \nknew? The Alliance might not know just what they were dealing with.\nBut then Iron Raptor sighed.\nWishful thinking.*\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
