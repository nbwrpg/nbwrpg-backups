The old one is under us\nright now. You&#39;re on Alliance Island, where both bases are stationed. The\nold one is buried underground, and provides the underwater shields while\nthis one provides the shields abovewater. During battle, the entire island\ncan be shielded, and if anyone tries to get here swimming, they&#39;d have a\nnice shock from the Iron Fist, which is the ship we&#39;re walking in. What\nwe&#39;re walking by now are the training rooms, by the way. This ship has the\nlatest Predacon technology, so those rooms are as advanced as\nyou&#39;d need. Anyways, right now we are allied with the Destrons and the\nPredacons. The Maximals are constantly being attacked by various factions,\nand to keep the enemies coming at them, we help them survive. As long as\nthey remain a popular target, this base will be left alone and power can\nbe diverted from defence to other projects. Down that hallway is the brig,\nnot usually used. To your left are the residential quarters, and the next\nleft turn from there leads to most of the storage rooms. Up front is the\nbridge.&quot;\n\nFZ reaches the doors to the bridge and they slide apart. He walks in,\nlooking around. &quot;This is the bridge. Top-of-the-line Predacon\ntechnology. To the left are the cargo and docking bays, and to the right\nare the labs. If we go through the door on the far side of the bridge and\nfollow the corridor to the end, we&#39;d exit the base. Down that ladder is\nthe engine room, which is one of the few engine rooms on the planet that&#39;s\nfully intact.&quot;\n\nHe pauses, looking at Wolfgang to see if the other had anything to say.\n\n\n\nOn Mon, 30 Apr 2001, War Barge wrote:\n\n&gt; :: Wolfgang ::\n&gt; \n&gt; :: Follows FZ ::\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
