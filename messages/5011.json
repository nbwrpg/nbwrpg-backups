She swooped down and \nlanded next to him.\n&quot;What?&quot;\nShe couldn&#39;t understand why this bot was acting so strangely towards her.  \n&quot;Why are you so worried about my wing.  It&#39;s damaged and so what.  Why would \nyou care.  Why worry about a coward like me.&quot;\nShe flew up into the tree that was next to Cybershark and tried to hide in \nthe branches.  She was ashamed of herself and didn&#39;t want to have others \nwaste thier time on a coward.\n\n-----------Original Message-----------\nFrom:   &lt;Dachande85@a...&gt;\nDate: Wed Jun 28, 2000 2:10pm\nSubject: Neo Beast Wars\n\n\n\n::CyberShark::\n\n    &quot;Wait!! I only wish to talk!&quot; CyberShark called out to Battera. He\nstarted to fly after her. &quot;I don&#39;t even know you name and you look hurt. \nWhat\nthe?&quot; He said, noticing the flying pterosaur (actual name of group). It was\nred in color, he scanned it and found it to be a Predacon.\n    &quot;That&#39;s funny I don&#39;t recall any Predacons being pterosaurs.&quot; CyberShark\nsaid to himself. &quot;No matter my primary concern is that bat. Hey! Stop for a\nsec, you look injured, my base isn&#39;t far from here, you could get repaired.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
