He wanted those beasts moved where\nhe could easier monitor them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Closing his wrist comp, he waits by the door for Lady Hawk to exit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;CYBERWOLF4&quot; &lt;cyberwolf4@p...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; OK. found it, One of three things must have occured.
