That would mean that most attempts to pick him up \n&gt; would be futile. The chains especially would fail (I was in a hurry \n&gt; posting at school and didn&#39;t realize that), and probably so would \n&gt; Menasor&#39;s and anyone else&#39;s grabs. However, Firearm is in stasis lock \n&gt; and can&#39;t move at all, so I can&#39;t really post for him being moved; \n&gt; the person moving him would be responsible for posting for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
