He\n&gt; hit the ground on his chest. He groaned and lifted his head slowly from\nthe\n&gt; ground.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Quickstrike froze. His optics widened. &quot;Sugar-bot?&quot; He slowly turned his\n&gt; head to Dark Mouse. He glowered, not liking this situation. But Megatron\n&gt; didn&#39;t say it was going to be easy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Megatron suddenly saw the auto-guns come on-line. His optics widened. He\n&gt; leaped out of the way and ran to the side of the ship. He transformed to\n&gt; robot mode. &quot;I believe it&#39;s time for us to talk!&quot; he called out.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
