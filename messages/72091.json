The social intrigues of Pr=\r\nedacon life was not his\n&gt; typical interest.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Perhaps that is why Taran=\r\ntulus chose this moment to reveal her.&quot;\n&gt; SKYSHADOW said. &quot;She may be able =\r\nto get closer to Hydras or Cryotek\n&gt; then he could.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW - DINOBOT&gt;\n\nTher=\r\ne was a contemplative pause from DINOBOT.  &quot;Perhpas.  But there aer too man=\r\ny pieces to this puzzle.  The Schemings of TARANTALUS, HYDRAS, and CRYOTEK =\r\nas well, and the ongoing schemes of each of their own underlings.  This sit=\r\nuation is too complex even within our own forces.  And we have the Maximals=\r\n and the followers of UNICRON to deal with as well, and other things.  We s=\r\npend too much of our time dealing with internal issues.  Pah.&quot;\n\nWalking alo=\r\nng then as the trio stomped off towards TARANTALUS&#39; bay.  &quot;And I am interes=\r\nted in finding out just how he was able to restore a protoform without the =\r\nrest of us knowing, Yess..&quot;\n\n\n&lt;OLD&gt;\n\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTULUS sighed as he looked at=\r\n BLACKARACHNIA, for a moment his\n&gt; insanity falling away to reveal the true=\r\n malevolent intellect that\n&gt; drove him. &quot;Sometime we must all do things tha=\r\nt we don&#39;t want to do\n&gt; dear to survive. As for CRYOTEK, that is why you ar=\r\ne here, find out\n&gt; what you can.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And then HYDRAS approached. TARANTUL=\r\nUS gave BLACKARACHNIA a knowing\n&gt; look before he turned to face HYDRAS.\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nThere was a smirk from BLACKARACHNIA, &quot;I thought th=\r\ne addage was &#39;any port in a storm for the rats deserting the sinking ships&#39;=\r\n?  If you&#39;re going to do something you don&#39;t like, you can at least be accu=\r\nrate as to your own circumstances.&quot;\n\nAnd then of his instructions over she =\r\nnodded.  &quot;So, do you want to do this the old fashioned way or other then?&quot;\n=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;OLD - HYDRAS&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hydras:: &quot;Deal, my tutor&quot;hissed Hydras with a =\r\nsmile and added to hid comlink\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Inferno, report?&quot; The Hydras came in th=\r\ne room and looking at both spiders\n&gt; &gt; said harshly&quot;TArantulus how did you =\r\nexplain this... unusual and non\n&gt; &gt; autorized Project????&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;OLD - CRYO=\r\nTEK AND COMPANY&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; CRYOTEK nodded as he followed behind HYDRAs, seemingl=\r\ny content to walk\n&gt; in his student&#39;s shadow, his malevolent optics staring =\r\nbalefully into\n&gt; the room.\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a dark and wicked chuckled from T=\r\nARANTULUS, his apparent\n&gt; bout of lucidity gone in an instant as he turned =\r\nto face HYDRAS, &quot;She\n&gt; is my project. I found her, I built her and now I ha=\r\nve restored her to\n&gt; the perfection that she was meant to be.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTU=\r\nLUS waved in the direction of BLACKARACNIA his hand going from\n&gt; her should=\r\ners to her hand, displaying her in much the same way an\n&gt; artist might disp=\r\nlay his best most treasured piece of art. &quot;She is\n&gt; everything she was mean=\r\nt to be and more.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; INFERNO who had been with HYDRAS up this point turn=\r\ned to him, I am here sir.&quot;\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW WASPINATOR/BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nAt this poin=\r\nt, as INFERNO came in escorting HYDRAS and CRYOTEK, and TARANTALUS pointed =\r\nover to BLACKARACHNIA, the first to break the silence before any of the oth=\r\ner officers was..\n\nWASPIANTOR.  &quot;Oooh, Spider-Bot hazz radioactive Spider-B=\r\nabe.  Wazzzpinator rememberzz!&quot;\n\nAt this point, there was a SIGH from BLACK=\r\nARACHNIA, &quot;The more things change..&quot;\n\nTurning over to CRYOTEK and HYDRAS, a=\r\nnd giving a lazy twirl and pirouette, winking her optic unit over at CRYOTE=\r\nK, &quot;A pleasure to make your..  Acquiantance.&quot;  Giving a sultry drop of her =\r\nvocalizer over at HYDRAS&#39; direction and then to CRYOTEK.\n\n\n"}}
