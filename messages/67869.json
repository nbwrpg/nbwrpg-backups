Suddenly he slips and &gt; falls down a small hill almost smacking into the shuttle. \n&gt;\n&gt; He jumps up, apparently uninjured and begins to chase his tail. \n&gt;\n&gt; Hydras:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;TRelos!!!&quot;hissed the male &quot;What are you doing?&quot;\n\nMyrmidon&#39;s massive black and purple frame emerged from the shuttle. For a moment , he looked around, sizing up the area, looking for points of attack, defence and opportunity. As his optics fell across Trelos he just shook his head at the foolishness. &quot;I do hope this is not the way he acts in the middle of battle.&quot;\n\nTurning away from the duo Myrmidon transformed, becoming a massive lion, complete with bold shoulder mounted cannons and serated teeth and claws. It was obvious that this form was made for clandestined affairs, he was strong yet agile, silent and yet agressive, he was both assasin and warrior. \n\nHe grunted as he stalked over to a nearby hiding place - a stone outcropping with foliage for cover. It was high up, with a commanding view of the area. With a thought Myrmidon activated his own cloak and slid into place, for the moment disappearing from sensors as the shadows in which he hid seemed to almost envelop him. He was ready to attack, poised to rip into any unfortunate Maximal that came his way!\n\n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
