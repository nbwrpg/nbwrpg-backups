You all \nknow my \n&gt;   first suggestion, here&#39;s my second:\n&gt; \n&gt;   Legacy dumps the poison, but it has a wierd affect on the nitrogen \nin \n&gt;   our atmosphere.  Most of it becomes Latent, but some of it \ninteracts \n&gt;   with our bots sending them into stasis until a decade in the \nfuture \n&gt;   (our future 2012 A.D.) so the story of the continent of Atlantis \nbeing \n&gt;   destroyed in a day and a night was really the story of a couple of \n&gt;   bots being put into stasis lock for a few million years and Plato \njust \n&gt;   left off a couple of zeros because he didn&#39;t believe the Earth \ncould \n&gt;   be that old when we think a zero got added in making it 10,000 \ninstead \n&gt;   of 1000 years.  But then they wake up in the near future and start \n&gt;   slaggin&#39; again.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    \n&gt; \n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
