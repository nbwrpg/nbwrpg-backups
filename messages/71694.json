He finds\n&gt; an area with even ground and makes his decent.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Hold on Noctorro, I&#39;m taking us down.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wings instinctively curl inward for landing as Tucson extends front and hind\n&gt; legs out to catch the ground on all fours.  With just a few wing beats he\n&gt; manages to approach land and softly slide into a graceful landing.  He\n&gt; continues to follow the beacon by foot.\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nThe cave is easy to find with the help of the beacon. It is well\ncamoflaged, but the beacon takes TUSCON right to it.\n\nTORCA stepped to the entrance of the cave, his thick frame covered in\nbattle scars and wounds, but he seemed to be fairly okay. AIRHAMMER is\nstanding over the heavily wounded forms of BANTOR and SILVERBOLT as\nthey lay down in the back of the cave.\n\n&quot;We just got our radios working again.&quot; TORCA said without much\npreamble. &quot;We were about to call for an evac when we got NOCTORRO&#39;s\ncall. I think most of us are okay, although Bantor will need some time\nin the CR chamber.&quot;\n\nTORCA pointed at SILVERBOLT, &quot;But he got it the worst of it. The\nseekers hit him with some sort of extraction device right on his spark\nchamber. Bantor dove in and knocked it away, but the backlash damaged\nthem both.&quot;\n\nAIRHAMMER nodded, &quot;After that we drove them off, but Bantor and\nSilverbolt were damaged.&quot; AIRHAMMER looked down at them. &quot;We don&#39;t\nknow how the damage is to Silverbolt. He has not awakened yet.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
