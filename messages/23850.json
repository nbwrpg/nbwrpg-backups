Half the e-mails I read were \nblurry^_^)\n\nTavatron had often wondered what may have been if certain circumstances had \nnot effected her life so greatly. Perhaps she would be back on Beta Prime, \narguing with her parents over trivial issues. At the time they were matters \nof great importance, now, however, they seemed like nothing compared to \ncurrent problems. So much had changed in such a small amount of time. It had \nonly taken hours before the colony was in ruins:\n\n&quot;They did not know what hit them.&quot;\n\nTavatron continued walking steadily onward, toward the CF. The lazy breezes \nblew past her, carrying new scents and sounds with them. This planet, the \nsurrounding area, reminded her of an old song from earth. It was something \nabout life, something her mother used to sing. She could vaguely recall the \ntune and a few words, but nothing else. It had been ages since she even \nthought about it, much less tried to recall what her mother looked like. The \npast could be quite painful, especially when one has run from it for so \nlong:\n\n&quot;Before I joined the forces I lived on Beta Prime; a colony in the Triceron \nGalaxy. We called it the Wasteland. It was a desert. The small community \nthat was there consisted mainly of miners and soldiers. There were a few \nfamilies, mine included.&quot;\n\nTavatron watched absentmindedly as two butterflies danced past her. They \nseemed to be dancing, almost floating on the unseen currents of the wind. \nThey reminded her of the glade she and Dinobot had visited not too long ago. \nIt had been beautiful, and the butterflies had been one of the first things \nshe had laid eyes on. There were many of them, all dancing past her and \nbeyond, into the surrounding forest. It had been so peaceful, so pleasant, \nand then the memory of the glade�s destruction flooded back, swamping her. \nWhy was everything she ever cared for, even had the slightest feeling for, \nalways taken from her at the last moment? Whenever she had begun to feel \ncomfortable, and� safe, something would happen. On Beta Prime it had been \nthe fire, on Earth, Obliteratron.\n\n&quot;There was a terrorist raid.&quot;\n\nTavatron sighed deeply. This was too much. It was taking all her will and \ninner strength to summon up that which she had worked so long and hard to \nsuppress. She could see the scene before her once again, the buildings \ncracking and burning, their supports no longer able to sustain their giant \nframes.\n\n&quot;Most that didn�t die in the fires were slaughtered by the storms. The \nsandstorms were like a fire themselves. They tore at a �bot until there was \nnothing left.&quot;\n\nShe shuddered to think of the poor souls that did survive the storms. They \nhadn�t lasted long. Tavatron could still hear their terrified cries. Without \nproper medical treatment they hadn�t stood a chance:\n\n&quot;Out of the 285 colonists only 15 survived.&quot;\n\nShe had suppressed most of the time on Beta Prime, all but the few precious \nmemories she had of herself and an old friend. Ironically he had been a male \ndesert lizard of some sort and a native of the planet. She couldn�t remember \nhis name anymore. Actually, now that she thought about it, she had never \nreally learned it. She had called him Lizard, probably because she couldn�t \npronounce his real name:\n\n&quot;I was 5 when the raid destroyed my home. My parents were killed in a storm \nsoon after. One other transformer of the same age and myself left the planet \ntwo years later with the surviving colonists.&quot;\n\nTavatron didn�t know why she was telling him all of this. Perhaps she would \nfeel better once she had shared it with someone. No one knew of the raid. \nThe government had done a superb job of erasing all traces of the colonists, \nincluding the old identities of the survivors. The adults had been given new \nnames and expensive jobs, while the few surviving children were left to \nwander aimlessly through the streets. According to a file she had \n�liberated� with the aid of a few other survivors they were expendable \ncommodities:\n\n&quot;We were expendable.&quot;\n\nTavatron kicked up small dust clouds as she walked, quietly humming an old \ntune under her breath. It took her several more moments before she realized \nwhat she was doing. She had always hummed a certain song while kicking up \nsand in the desert. It was a game she and her friends used to play. The \nobject was to see who could kick the sand the highest before the song ended. \nTavatron quickly cleared her throat and looked away. She had avoiding any \neye contact with Dinobot this entire time, and now she was afraid he had \nnoticed her little slip. The song she had been humming was slow and steady, \nbut with a bouncy beat to it. She was still stepping in time to it, however, \nthough she hadn�t realized it yet:\n\n&quot;When I was old enough I joined the forces.&quot;\n\nShe had been a Predacon at the time, but it hadn�t taken much to convince \nher to switch sides. Death had been the final straw:\n\n&quot;Someone who was very close to me died while serving in the forces. He had \nbeen shot and burned nearly beyond recognition. When I saw him he was laying \non a metal table in a make shift medical facility with tubes down his \nthroat�&quot;\n\nA gentle cawing brought Tavatron out of her zombie like state. She had \nforgotten she was talking, and whom she was talking to. The past was past, \nwhy did he have to force her to bring it up again? Tavatron took a deep \nbreath. She was almost done, and the base loomed on the distant horizon. She \nhad been talking for some time, something she was prone to do when it came \nto matters of the past. The base, however, was still a long way off. It \nwould take them a little longer to get there, but not much:\n\n&quot;He died.&quot;\n\nShe remembered how his parents had cried when she told them the horrible \nnews. She had stood there, back straight and gaze unwavering, while they \nsobbed in each other�s arms. All the while all she could think was why him? \nShe was too stunned, and too well trained to resort to tears. Sorrow was a \nweak emotion. After deserting and joining the Maximal forces she had \nregained some of her feelings, but not enough. She still couldn�t shed tears \nfor her fallen comrades, and most likely never would.\n\n&quot;When I saw you lying there, you reminded me of something I had fought long \nand hard to forget. I couldn�t handle it.&quot;\n\nMost �bots would have regretted spending their childhood stealing and \nrunning wild through the streets. She had no regrets. She had learned things \non the streets that no school could ever teach her, things that had saved \nher life countless times over. She wanted to forget, but knew she couldn�t. \nHer past was a part of her, whether she liked it or not.\n\nTavatron knew this was no excuse for her actions, and Dinobot would probably \nagree with her. But right now all she wanted to do was rest, or at least eat \nsomething. Too much had happened in too little a time frame for her to go \nany longer without food or sleep. She wanted to tell Dinobot as well, but he \nwas probably too sore to hunt. She had to fight the urge to pounce on even \nthe smallest of creatures.\n\nTavatron looked toward her companion, as always he had a scowl on his face, \nas if he were deep in thought or about to kill something. Tavatron stared \naimlessly into the cloudy sky, occasionally watching a bird or two glide \npast. Tavatron�s gaze drifted toward the CF, where she could barely make out \nthe outlines of the Alliance gestalts.\n\n&quot;The Cybertronian Fire is under attack!&quot;\n\nTavatron reverted to beast mode and turned to see if Dinobot had heard her. \nShe didn�t have the time to wait right now, the CF was in trouble:\n\n&quot;We have to hurry, or else we may arrive too late.&quot;\n\nTavatron began to run across the plains as quickly as possible. Her paws \npounded against the soft earth as she tore across it. If now was ever the \ntime to utilize her enhancements, this was it.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
