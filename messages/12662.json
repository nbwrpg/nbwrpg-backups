He stumbled a few times, finding that his left foot was \ndamaged from Rowdy Wolf&#39;s encounter. Something was going on near-by. \nHe could hear it. He couldn&#39;t turn his back on him yet, he could fire \non him, causing more damage than he already had. \n\nHe kept backing up, watching Rowdy Wolf&#39;s fading figure as he finally \nmade his way out of the forest. He looked around.\n\n\n"}}
