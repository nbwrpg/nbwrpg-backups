Time ta reload and keep shooting.  Sheesh, t=\r\nhey even come outa the woodwork.&quot;\n\nIn the mean time Tucson could now see Ma=\r\ngmatrons body mass and could see that although heavily armored and powerful=\r\n, it had to be difficult for him to remain agile in that form.  Agility was=\r\n the key in this battle and perhaps the traditional battle of bruit force w=\r\nas not the trick against Magmatron.  And without saying anything at all, Tu=\r\ncson becomes very springy on his feet and manages to elude his fire by adop=\r\nting a very spring like vault to his step, even on two legs.  His body move=\r\ns as fluidly as that of a gymnast , as he performs a series of complex flip=\r\ns in beast form, while his tail follows as a rudder, to balance him in mid =\r\nair. Yet the blast does catch the very tip of his tail, as he extinguishes =\r\nthe flame with a short shake at the tip.\n\nAnd then he wondered, what if he =\r\ncould get Magmatron to be buried by his own fire power, rather than wasting=\r\n his own energy to do it?  He raises a brow with a coy smirk.\n\nAs Straights=\r\nhot moves out of the way of where Saberback once stood, but replaced by a g=\r\niant boulder, she could now see Tucson facing Magmatron but is swift to cat=\r\nch onto what he was about  to do .  \n\n&quot; If he&#39;s gonna do what I think he&#39;s =\r\ngonna do, he needs something ta dance to.  Ohh I hope my on board radio sti=\r\nll works...  &quot;\n\nShe checks for a signal and then, music.  Music that was of=\r\nten played at the Blue Diode, which is equivalent to techno music to modern=\r\n man.  Tucson looks out of the corner of his eye, over to his sister who gi=\r\nves him the thumbs up .  He nods and then his agile footwork becomes more t=\r\nhan the usual steps of combat, it evolves into full blown dance!  \n\n&quot; I bel=\r\nieve this is where we literally turn up the volume.&quot;\n\nQuickstride looks ove=\r\nr as does Rattrap.\n\n&quot; Heeeey he didn&#39;t tell us he could move like that, loo=\r\nk at him go!

Getting now that\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n SKYBYTE was seemingly directing them, but holding back behind the fray, he=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; let out a snarl.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Going to try and whip up his tail cannon to bla=\r\nst a snap shot at SKYBYTE,\n&gt;&gt; one of the SHARKTICONS leaping up and latchin=\r\ng it&#39;s teeth inot it, half\n&gt;&gt; severing DINOBOT&#39;s ARM!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The b=\r\nlast from DINOBOT=E2=80=99s cannon sped fast and true across the cave\n&gt; flo=\r\nor, moving past several SHARKTICONS including several that\n&gt; attempted to i=\r\nntercept it and hit SKYBYTE square in the chest, sending\n&gt; the bot sprawlin=\r\ng across the floor!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Quickstride was getting t=\r\nired of the Sharkitcons and gets into\n&gt;&gt; robot mode bearing his over the sh=\r\noulder blast cannon.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; Okay, that&#39;s it, it&#39;s fish frying time!  Head=\r\ns up Rattrap!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Rattrap quickly scoots out of Quickstrides way.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &quot; FIRE IN THE HOLE!&quot;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Quickstride now attempts to take out a large =\r\ngroup of Sharkticons with a\n&gt;&gt; shot from the blast cannon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The attack =\r\nfrom the shoulder blast cannon does indeed seem to have an\n&gt; affect as seve=\r\nral go down at once, a couple even exploding into\n&gt; multicolored clouds of =\r\nmetal and ash!\n&gt; \n&gt; Much like of DINOBOT it would appear that QUICKSTRIDE=\r\n=E2=80=99s cannon is\n&gt; thinning out their numbers. However with SKYBYTE now=\r\n temporally\n&gt; distracted by DINOBOT=E2=80=99s blast it takes them a few mom=\r\nents more to\n&gt; recover this time -- A few moments that the MAXIMAL FUZORS u=\r\nse to\n&gt; their advantage, flying in and attacking SKYBYTE himself!\n&gt; \n&gt; NOCT=\r\nORRO, among the fastest of their number streaks in to tackle the\n&gt; already =\r\nhit SHARTICON leader while AIRHAMMER and BANTOR tried\n&gt; valiantly to keep t=\r\nhe slowly ebbing tide of SHARKTICONS off of\n&gt; NOCOTORRO!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Meanwhile, VICE GRIP was being gradually..  Chewed apart by the SHARKTICON=\r\nS,\n&gt;&gt; buried in a pile of them and thrashing about, his most opwerful weapo=\r\nns\n&gt;&gt; useless as he was SHARKPILED&lt; their teeth threatening tos kewer him l=\r\nayer by\n&gt;&gt; layer!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;NEW&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; The SHARKTICONS continue to attempt to ma=\r\nul VICE GRIP, their teeth\n&gt; trying to grind through his armor . . .  until =\r\nsuddenly they are not!\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickly, as if stung, they rose into the air go=\r\ning to defend their\n&gt; master who was now under assault by the MAXIMAL FUZOR=\r\nS and, at least\n&gt; for a moment, DINOBOT!\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &lt;OLD&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Tucson concentr=\r\nates and remains focused as he continues to match Magmatrons\n&gt;&gt; moves simpl=\r\ny to defend himself against his onslaught.  He knew his sword was\n&gt;&gt; not bi=\r\ng as Magmatrons nor was it made to handle its power.  Knowing that, he\n&gt;&gt; o=\r\npts not to use the sword.    Narrowing a brow in thought he quickly goes\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n from robot to beast mode, landing on his hind feet and using his front leg=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; as arms and hands.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; The sword may not have the strength nor the =\r\nsize but he knew his tail could\n&gt;&gt; be strong and long enough of a weapon fo=\r\nr him.  With surprising grace he\n&gt;&gt; whirls the tail masterfully into a coil=\r\n and slaps at Magmatrons sword to\n&gt;&gt; attempt a tail block by slapping it wi=\r\nth the side of the skinnier part of\n&gt;&gt; his long tail with a forceful swipe.=\r\n  His long neck coils back like that of\n&gt;&gt; a serpent ready to strike.  Yet =\r\nhe remains calm without any explosive\n&gt;&gt; temperamental outbursts.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &quot; =\r\nA worthy opponent indeed.  But can you face me in  your own beast mode as\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; I am facing you in mine?  You seem attached to your robot mode, Magmatron=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; is there something you&#39;re not telling me, about your level of expertis=\r\ne?  Or\n&gt;&gt; is it that because you are contrived of a mixture of creatures th=\r\nat are not\n&gt;&gt; known for combative agility?  As you can well imagine, a drag=\r\non faces\n&gt;&gt; similar weaknesses.  And you may ask yourself why would a drago=\r\nn take on a\n&gt;&gt; posture that would expose him to injury?  Or is it that the =\r\ndragon may have\n&gt;&gt; learned to adapt to such weaknesses?  Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;r=\r\ne a very charismatic\n&gt;&gt; individual but, are you witty enough to step outsid=\r\ne the box?  Let&#39;s see if\n&gt;&gt; you are.  Come on then, I&#39;m sure a beast of you=\r\nr caliber can make short work\n&gt;&gt; of a smaller mountain dragon.  Show me wha=\r\nt you&#39;re really made of,\n&gt;&gt; transform, and face me in your beast mode!

Armored from snou=\r\nt to rump\n&gt; MAGMATON stood up on his hind legs and flapped his wings in an =\r\nalmost\n&gt; leisurely fashion.

With a loud crack stone and rock dislodge themse=\r\nlves and large\n&gt; pieces fall from the roof!\n&gt; \n&gt; SABERBACK had not been pay=\r\ning attention to TORCA or STRAIGHTSHOT.\n&gt; Instead he had been looking at OP=\r\nTIMUS PRIME who instead of being dead\n&gt; as he had thought had just opened c=\r\nrimson optics.

Gone was any play at finesse or art, gone was any knowledge of\n&gt;=\r\n martial art or style, it was pure brute strength and tenacity that\n&gt; kept =\r\nthese two going.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, above them, over the pit the darkened figu=\r\nre of OPTIMUS\n&gt; PRIME looked at the approaching figures of the PREDACON FUZ=\r\nORS who had\n&gt; been fighting their way across the battle field to get to him=\r\n and then\n&gt; glanced down at the two figures fighting below him smiling as h=\r\ne did\n&gt; so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Looking up at his hands he clenched his fists and with a m=\r\nassive surge\n&gt; of power broke the chains that held him and he began to plum=\r\nmet down\n&gt; towards the pit and towards RODIMUS and DARK RODIMUS who were up=\r\n to\n&gt; this point totally unaware of the threat coming right at him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (T=\r\nAG)\n&gt; \n&gt; - Preston\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!=\r\n Groups Links\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
