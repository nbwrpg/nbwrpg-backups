The hall is\nquiet, lights bink at various points indicating various states of\nrediness around the base. There are doors at certain points, each of\nthem, judging by the red light on each one, is securely locked, barred\nagainst intrusion.\n\nAt the end of the hall is a rather stout looking door. This door looks\nas if it could stand up against the dinobots, at least for a few\nminutes. A bluish purple light scans over Cryotek, and after a moment\nof contemplation the door slides open allowing Cryotek and Hydras,\nalong with thier escort to enter into the room.\n\n&quot;Here.&quot; Cryotek said in grand tones. &quot;Here is where I house the\nprotoforms.&quot; Cryotek gestures at two &#39;tanks&#39; each of which hold a\nsingle protoform. The first one is fairly standard, no iff signature\nto speak of. The second one is strangely different. While it has the\ngeneral shape of a protoform it is black in color and it has a\ndefinite temporal signature to it - similar to the one that Hydras may\nremember came from Legacy.\n\nOOC: Hydras might be aware of Legacy from when they all battled the\nminons at the Ark, or from when Legacy helped rescue the Rodimus and\nTuscon from the black tower. It&#39;s up to you Airly if Hydras will\nremember this or not.\n\n(TAG)\n\n\nPreston\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\nYahoo! Groups Links\n\n\n\n\n"}}
