The smell of food brought\n&gt; him out of his anger enough to get him modivated. He heard the flapping of\n&gt; Terrorsaur&#39;s wings when he approached her. And at the corner of his eyes,\nhe\n&gt; could see the dactyl going for the meat that was set for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He wasn&#39;t going to have it. The instant the red dactyl came in arms\nlength,\n&gt; Quickstrike threw his arm out and stuck his head. Terrorsaur&#39;s long beak\n&gt; missed. He sqwaked from the hit, and flew towards the outside of the cave,\n&gt; grumbling.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Beat ya to it!&quot; the young Fuzor snapped at the dactyl, mocking him. &quot;Go\nget\n&gt; yer own!&quot; He laughed in a victorious way. &quot;Did ya see that?&quot; he said to\n&gt; Stingtra. He was just too proud of himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; He transformed to his beast mode and snatched the meat up. He crawled away\n&gt; from Stingtra and went to a place where he could eat.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free, Unlimited Calls Anywhere!\n&gt; Conference in the whole family on the same call.\n&gt; Let the fights begin!
