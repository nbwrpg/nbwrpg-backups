Two of the Minions have \nsuccessfully brainwashed him... I think.  A tricky one, Malice.  \nThere is a femme currently inside the base, named Wolfblade, who has \ngreat feelings for him.  But her player has disappeared right now.  \nMalice is sparing against the minion Blacknightmare right now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Megatron Revived/ Organics:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Megatron Revived kneeled down to see what exactly Fortuneteller \nwas doing.  He tried scanning fo unusual energies, but came up with \nnothing.\n&gt; &quot;How does this work, I have seen many things many spiritual \nceremonies, but never something like this.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Organics leaned over Fortuneteller to see what she is doing.  She \nkept her questions to herself.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Kyle Stewart &lt;dewboy30816@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We shall see,&quot; she said, she whispered the question\n&gt; to her bolts and thew them down on the ground in front\n&gt; of the bot. &quot;Their pattern will tell all...hmmm...I\n&gt; see you have a great power, it is the shadow of the\n&gt; light that was your undoing...oh, and yes, I believe I\n&gt; see something about Malice, but it&#39;s vague, allow me a\n&gt; moment.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Sorry, I thought I sent it to the group. Anyway,\n&gt; how is Malice?\n&gt; \n&gt; --- &quot;The Ultimate Archfiend of Darkness, Devouring&quot;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Megatron Revived:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Then... Do you know if Malice is okay? Tell me,\n&gt; &gt; will Malice return \n&gt; &gt; to us?&quot; the clone demanded.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: Fortuneteller&#39;s player sent this to me instead\n&gt; &gt; of the group. \n&gt; &gt; So here it is. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fortuneteller:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;I believe I may be able to asist you in your\n&gt; &gt; battle against Unicron,&quot; said Fortuneteller, &quot;we\n&gt; &gt; Gypsyions have some ability to forsee what will be.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She knew she couldn&#39;t reveal the full extent of her\n&gt; &gt; power, but she COULD use it to gain their\n&gt; &gt; trust...and\n&gt; &gt; then backstab them.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: Don&#39;t count Malice out yet. Right now he is\n&gt; &gt; under Unicron&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; influance, capable of anything. Look to Ydrassil,\n&gt; &gt; Windlord, perhaps \n&gt; &gt; Hydras or some other Pred.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Friends.  Fun.
