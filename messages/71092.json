He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; uses sharp hearing to pick up the smallest of sounds, e=\r\nven those deemed\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be completely silent. He pays close attention t=\r\no how the ground seems\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vibrate under his feet, giving him indica=\r\ntion that although hidden, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tell where his opponent was=\r\n. He slowly brings Straight Shot around.\n&gt; With\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one of his arms injur=\r\ned, he had to do things in reverse. With the good\n&gt; arm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hold t=\r\nhe weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the trigger.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n had often practiced alternating between his hands, and was glad he had\n&gt; d=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous was an attribute. He loads an arrow =\r\nspecifically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; designed to be barbed and most difficult to remove. He k=\r\nnew that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better just to disable his enemy rather than destroy =\r\nhim. He needed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nightrazor for questioning. Most effective area of tar=\r\ngeting, would be\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; knee joint Imbed the arrow in a joint and his =\r\nopponent would find it\n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult to abmulate, yet it would not=\r\n kill or destroy him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now within striking distance, as determin=\r\ned by his sonar sensors, he\n&gt; sends\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out short pulse emissions to pinp=\r\noint his area of targeting. His\n&gt; reading is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quick, yet, anythi=\r\nng could happen at this point.

He&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; uses=\r\n sharp hearing to pick up the smallest of sounds, even those deemed to&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; be completely silent. He pays close attention to how the ground se=\r\nems to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vibrate under his feet, giving him indication that alt=\r\nhough hidden, he&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; could&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; tell where his opponent wa=\r\ns. He slowly brings Straight Shot around. With&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; one of his arms=\r\n injured, he had to do things in reverse. With the good arm,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; hold the weight of his weapon, and with the bad arm, pull the =\r\ntrigger. He&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; had often practiced alternating between his hands,=\r\n and was glad he had done&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; so. Being ambidextrous =\r\nwas an attribute. He loads an arrow specifically&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; designed to =\r\nbe barbed and most difficult to remove. He knew that it was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; be=\r\ntter just to disable his enemy rather than destroy him. He needed&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Nightrazor for questioning. Most effective area of targeting, would be =\r\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; knee joint Imbed the arrow in a joint and his opponent wo=\r\nuld find it most&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; difficult to abmulate, yet it would not kill =\r\nor destroy him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Now within striking distance, as =\r\ndetermined by his sonar sensors, he sends&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; out short pulse emi=\r\nssions to pinpoint his area of targeting. His reading is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; quick, yet, anything could happen at this point. He aims, and attem=\r\npts to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; launch an arrow deep into his enemy&#39;s knee, if his =\r\ncalculations were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; correct.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;St=\r\neady Straight Shot. We need to make this count.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Straight Shot programs her mechanisms for optimal effeciency.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Talk about a shot in the dark.

We are&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; under attack by the Predacons.&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus nodded as he looked over at Ramulu=\r\ns, Ramulus nodded back at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &qu=\r\not;Elita.&quot; Rodimus said to his his little one. &quot;I will have to le=\r\nave you&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramulus so I can go defend=\r\n the Ark. Stay with him, and he will keep you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; safe.&quot=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; MEANWHILE ON THE BRIDGE:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; After defusing the bomb, Quickstride heaves a sigh of relief, w=\r\nhich is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well earned. He looks over to Wing Caliber while=\r\n holding his chest.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Whe=\r\nwww, ohh boy, talk about a major pulsator stopper.

With a few&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; deft movements of his fingers he brings up the main view =\r\nscreen. &quot;Hydras&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; several sweep=\r\ns are attacking.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Wing Caliber tur=\r\nned to look at Quickstride, &quot;It would seem that this is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; over yet.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Wing Caliber was attempting to bring main external weapons online or th=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shields, but at the moment nothing was working.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A call came in from Legacy, &quot;We are attem=\r\npting to bring shields and/or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weapons back online, pleas=\r\ne stand by.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Meanwhile, Tucson too, approaches the ninja intruder, and ignores that&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little warning about his energy reserves going low. He ha=\r\nd dealt with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; intruders of the dark many times, and being =\r\nvisually impaired, he knew&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; how&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to unlock the=\r\nir secrets of steath. He nodds to Legacy&#39;s reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; Understood Legacy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &q=\r\nuot;Rodimus, this is Tucson. I&#39;ve approached the area where the intrude=\r\nr&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; located. I&#39;m hoping the doors clos=\r\ne properly to ensure capture. I sense&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; enemy is much like myself, and instead of putting Uproar and Leo ll in&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grave&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; danger, I will take on the intru=\r\nder personally. He has crossed the line&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\ny envronment, and it&#39;s time he pays the price by someone who is as&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; versed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in stealth as he is. I ask you to call b=\r\nack Uproar and Leo ll to prevent&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; further harm to them.&qu=\r\not;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His optics narrow. He dra=\r\nws Straight Shot in his hands, to begin his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little game =\r\nof cat and mouse.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;NEW&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus replied, &quot;Uproar and Leo should be =\r\nabout there as well. I will&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; send&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them =\r\na message. I am on the way out to protect the Ark!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As Rodimus continued towards the door he sent a message t=\r\no Uproar and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Leo,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Hold back! Tuscon sa=\r\nid he would take the battle against the intruder.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; OUTSIDE THE ARK:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;OLD&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hydras continue =\r\nfightting the maximals&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Outsid=\r\ne the Ark, Night Shift quickly transforms and charges the enemy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a plasma riffle in hand, firing rounds,=\r\n hoping to strike at least Scourge&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Cyclonus, in hopes to disable them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; We got some serious bolts ta pick with you punks=\r\n!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap also fires h=\r\nis own weaponry.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Yeah! =\r\nLet&#39;s see how you guys like be&#39;n trapped like rats!

The sweeps fan out, using&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nheir&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; superior maneuverability to its greatest advantage a=\r\ns they try to come at&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the Maximals from all sides at once=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Rat Trap and Nightshift&#39;s weapons=\r\n fire back up into the air, although&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nime it seems to be of no avail as the sweeps twist and turn to avoid&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps are nothing if not smooth an=\r\nd agile!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps come back for anoth=\r\ner run when Silverbolt and Noctorro sweep&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; from around one side, their weapon&#39;s fire cutting into the sweeps,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; damaging&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one, and sending another falling=\r\n to the ground with a plume of smoke and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire trailing a=\r\nfter it!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The sweeps seemed temporarily =\r\nstunned with the Fuzor&#39;s and the Maximal&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; charge=\r\n into the battle, that is until Cyclonus, Deepstryke and Waspinator&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; show up!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Waspinator angles =\r\nin, opening fire on Rat Trap, &quot;Waspinator say he&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; getting&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tired of blowing up Maximals!&quot; he chuckled as he sai=\r\nd this, his wings&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buzzing as he continued firing at Rat =\r\nTrap. &quot;Then again maybe not!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Meanwhile the floating mobile cannon slash weapons satellite floats in&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; air, orienting its powerful main gun on Nig=\r\nhtshift and opening up with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bursts from his powerful ion=\r\n blast cannons!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However last, but defin=\r\nitely NOT least Cyclonus floats in, looking&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; majestic&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; and almost regal as he maneuvered in over the battle. In his =\r\njet mode he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked to be like a hawk or an eagle, starin=\r\ng down at some bit of prey on&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the ground, waiting for jus=\r\nt the right time to pounce on it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There=\r\n is a small click from beneath his wings and then twin pylons drop&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; from&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; them, their aft sends igniting and they t=\r\nake off targeting the Maximals&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; below!!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *It would seem that this battle has begun in earnest!*&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Preston&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
