Her own den not all that far away if he did not. *\n\n� I hope that I am still welcome to accompany you to you home?�\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
