One of the clones was dead. But he wanted \ntheir leader out. He dodged their randomly shot bullets, and than \nturned his jet pack on. He went right above Inferno, and shot rapidly \ndown on him.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\nTrainers\n\nPrebon got upset. He saw Ramulus, but this other bot? This was not \npart of the deal. But maybe....this bot was just small back up. Maybe \nwith him here, there was less chance of an ambush. This Ramulus must \nbe very dumb.\n\n&quot;What is the meaning of this? You were supposed to come alone \nRamulus! Why is he here?&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, Ignatius saw something he didn&#39;t like while he was gazing \nwith his piercing Eagle Eye&#39;s.\n\n&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Hammer\n\n&quot;I&#39;m not sure....but something&#39;s not right over there. Movement in \nthe bushed. I don&#39;t like it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmm... maybe they were thinking the same we were thinking. This \nRamulus must be very smart. Ignatius, take to the skies and look over \neverything carefully. Blaze, get a bit closer and see if you can \nsmell anything. Report back once you have anything.&quot;\n\nIgnatius and Blaze left the group.\n\n\n"}}
