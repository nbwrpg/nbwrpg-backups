You would need \ntorpedoes or mecanically propelled weaponry in order to bypass the water \nlimitations. I&#39;m not sure about this, but maybe you could use gauss rifles \n(like in battletech/mechwarrior) that throw simple iron bullets at high \nspeed with magnetic projection.\n\n\n&gt;From: Legendarynemasis@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Alecto\n&gt;Date: Wed, 25 Jul 2001 08:53:12 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;OOC: Yeah, your right. I checked Ben yees site too just now since I knew it\n&gt;would have the answer. Heh still 300 years is ample enough time to advance\n&gt;weapons technology of missiles and other weapons.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nT�l�chargez MSN Explorer gratuitement � l&#39;adresse \nhttp://explorer.msn.fr/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
