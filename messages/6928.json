Kluster ran off before Phobia could show him what \nhe brought him yhere for. Oh well he could still show Hysteria \n(Kluster ordered her along so I&#39;m guessing she&#39;s there.)\n&quot;Come with me my sweet&quot; (If she follows) He leads her to a series of \ntransport crates and turns toward a control on the wall, &quot;Computer \nopen crates in hold B major.&quot;\n\nThe crates opened on one side exposing the contents, &quot;These are \nPredacon Decimator Rifles, Intended for use if we found any hostiles \non Mettallicis. These are just some of the things the scavengers that \nfound my ship let me take with me.&quot;\n\n(If Hysteria didn&#39;t follow then)\nPhobia turns and places a handfull of Babies on the ground outside \nhis ship, &quot;This is a message for Kluster&quot; He hoped that the Predicons \nwouldn&#39;t find the message.&quot;You left before I could show my \nappreciation for your assistance. If our technologies are compatible \nI may be able to provide you with the resources you need to repair \nyour ship. To respond just tell my baby to send a response. Its \nsending parameters are offline until it hears that command. Phobia \nout.&quot; the babies turn and scamper back towards the cybertronian fire. \nHe sent multiple babies carrying the same message, at least one \nshould find it&#39;s mark.\n\nHe set another handfull down,&quot;Message for Predicons, This is Phobia \nto Predicon teams, I wish to join your ranks and meet with your \nleaders. I need a promise of protection. I have something you will \nwant as trade for amnesty.&quot; That group was intended for the Predicon \nattackers, set to the signatures he detected. the babies turned and \nheaded back to the battlefield.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Kluster::\n&gt; \n&gt; Kluster reaches Phobia&#39;s ship, stopping. &quot;Here you are.
