He pulls a \nmachine over to Condor&#39;s head, attaches electrodes and such to \nthe sides of Condor&#39;s temples and begins reprograming the bot. \nThen he recieves the comm from Fireblade. \n\t&quot;Fireblade, I am in my lab right now, you can come down here. \nThe reprograming of Condor has begun,&quot; the commlink closes, and \nhe laughs to himself, rubbing his hands together.\n\n"}}
