The weapon and shield are a plasma sword and \n&gt; shield. They are both light and you should have no problem using \n&gt; them to defeat enemies. The plasma blade will become surrounded \n&gt; in miniature bluish flames when you begin to use it. When \n&gt; damaging enemies, it causes blade damage plus the bluish flames \n&gt; will stick to the damaged area, and cause excruciating pain, \n&gt; without inflicting more damage. The shield has a moderate ability \n&gt; to absorbe heat. Use them wisely, for your sake and mine.&quot; He \n&gt; chuckles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swoop dodges weapon fire and the collapsing ceiling, then leaps \n&gt; into flight. He circles wildly around the small room, looking for a \n&gt; new target, but not wanting to hurt any friends.\n\n\n"}}
