He didnt want to be against them.  Bigfish also liked\n&gt;the idea\n&gt; &gt; of fighting other bots, this excited Bigfish.  He swam up to the\n&gt;bot known\n&gt; &gt; as DevilDuer.  a stream of bubbles flowed behind him.  DevilDuer\n&gt;looked calm\n&gt; &gt; and very pord of himself.  Bigfish new this was the clan to be\n&gt;in.  &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; except your offer DevilDuer. I want to join you and be apart of The\n&gt; &gt; Alliance. I will be loyal to your leader and obay all orders.&quot;\n&gt;Bigfish bowed\n&gt; &gt; his head very slitly to show his respect.\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
