A beam shoots towards Africa and scans a black \n&gt; panther. Inside the bot is given this beast mode and REFORMATED. He \n&gt; has the same weapons as Optimus Prime in BM except he can only \n&gt; partially absorb the weapons fire. He opens a com link to his own \n&gt; time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bot: This is Optimus Fury. I am proceeding toward the inferior \n&gt; Angilions. They will agree to be reformatted or they will join \n&gt; millions of &quot;accidental&quot; deaths since the Maxis and Preds hunted \ndown \n&gt; and destroyed Cheetor&#39;s team and killed most of there followers in \n&gt; attempts to deformat them. Because we are the Malacons. We live in \n&gt; secret, and destroy those inferior to us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Comm: Good. Don&#39;t return without a prize, reformatted or dead. Soon \n&gt; with a little elbow grease (lol) we will be 2% of the population and \n&gt; the Angelions will still be clueless about us.\n&gt; \n&gt; He proceeds to &quot;destroy the evidense&quot; by aiming his shuttle at the \n&gt; Atlantic Ocean and parachuting out over England. When he lands he \n&gt; goes to Beast Mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; OF: Stealth Mode.\n&gt; \n&gt; Holograms make him look like a real panther.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I made sure he wasn&#39;t illegal, but you can&#39;t accept him without \n&gt; BM. Try to denig it now.\n\n\n"}}
