I&#39;m not controlling him.  You moving out \nof the way would be moding.  And it doesn&#39;t really matter if you&#39;re ready to \nloose Suukie.  I&#39;ve lost a few of my characters before I wanted to, but I \ndidn&#39;t whine.  And blowing apart Suukie&#39;s gut wouldn&#39;t necessarily kill him.  \nSo stop moding, and shut up.  The barrel is less than millimeter away, if \nSuukie had done the same to any of my guys, unless he was aiming at shield or \nthey had a personal energy shield, I couldn&#39;t do a dang thing about it.  \n\n"}}
