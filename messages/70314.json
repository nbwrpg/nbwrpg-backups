Be=\r\ning a large truck, Tucson is \n&gt; &gt; far too heavy to go too fast in such a sh=\r\nort length of time, so 0 to 60 \n&gt; &gt; sounds just about right.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BIC:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson didn&#39;t care about surface or internal damage at this time, he=\r\n was \n&gt; &gt; far more concerned about keeping his comrades safe from harm.  Qu=\r\nickstride \n&gt; &gt; quickly goes top side to see if Talon needs assistance as St=\r\nraight Shot \n&gt; &gt; quickly attends to Perceptor.  Both of which find themselv=\r\nes attempting to \n&gt; &gt; ward off the enemy with either arrow or high powered =\r\ngun fire.  The \n&gt; &gt; insects atop Tucson were posing a major threat to Legac=\r\ny and Talon, as \n&gt; &gt; Quickstride tries desperately to back them up, shootin=\r\ng repeatedly to \n&gt; &gt; attempt to get the enemy off Tucson&#39;s trailer before t=\r\nhey did any harm to \n&gt; &gt; his comrades.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, a little more pest c=\r\nontrol than I bargained for! Legacy, Talon, \n&gt; &gt; you two okay?!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; St=\r\nraight Shot too, finds herself firing off arrows just to try and slow \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe insect beings down, while she desperately tries to help Perceptor.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot; That does it!  I wish these ugly bugs would turn around and get \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthemselves caught in a spider web!  Hang in there Perceptor, I got your \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; back!&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tucson was becomming more and more annoyed by the insects.=\r\n  Something had \n&gt; &gt; to be done before they destroyed his comrades.  He fel=\r\nt it was HIS \n&gt; &gt; responsibility to see to the welfare of his fellow Autobo=\r\nts and Maximals. \n&gt; &gt; He was the one in charge of their well being.  He hop=\r\ned by attempting a \n&gt; &gt; Sonar blast attack, he could immoblize the bug brig=\r\nade.  It would be a \n&gt; &gt; bold move on his part, and this he knew would hurt=\r\n Perceptor immensely, \n&gt; &gt; since he was a predacon.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Perceptor, I n=\r\need you to turn off your audio sensors for a short time. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m going to =\r\nattempt a sonar blast which I hope will slow things down for \n&gt; &gt; us enough=\r\n to get to Rodimus.  That way I know I will not harm you when I \n&gt; &gt; do emi=\r\nt this attack. Straight Shot, when I&#39;m through doing that, tap him \n&gt; &gt; on =\r\nthe shoulder to let him know it&#39;s safe to turn them back on.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; She n=\r\nodds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Roger that Tucson Prime.  Okay Perceptor, to be on the safe =\r\nside, it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; best if you shut down your audio sensors now.
