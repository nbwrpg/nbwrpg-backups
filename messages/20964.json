And I think I&#39;ve \nfallen too far behind in the story, and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to take \nback my chars. So, Yanshosh already has Fliq and Logo already has \nStarscream and Vulois. You guys can keep them, if it&#39;s all right with \nyou. Now, Soulstice and I were disscussing something that I could do \nwith Fliq and one of his chars, but Fliq is already with Yanshosh. So \nI&#39;m giving Gotron to Soulstice, and he can use him as he wants. But \nthat still leaves The Trainers and Savage up in the air. If you want \nthem, e-mail me. I&#39;m not sure I want to give possesion of all of them \nto one person. I would be too much power. I may even keep one of them \njust to make sure everything doesn&#39;t go out of control. But e-mail if \nyou want them. Tomorrow at about this time I will have my new chars \nup. I have it all set out and everything, but I&#39;m try to work out \nkinks in the origin stories. So, I&#39;ll see you all tomorrow. And thank \nyou all for being patient with me. It means a lot to me.\n\n\n"}}
