Finding it quite remarkable herself.\nBut a smile turned the corners of her lips as Prowl said the words that she \nhad been waiting for since she had woken up, meeting his lips half way in \nthe kiss.\nFeeling nothing other then love in Prowls mind, and how good he felt about \nholding her.\n\nIron Raptor deepened the kiss a bit, feeling just a tad bit out of place \nwith the fact that the only thing between her body and Prowls was a thin \nline of white hair.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
