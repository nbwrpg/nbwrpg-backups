But that was just him. And his mind toyed with the possibilities \nthat perhaps IronRaptor was weak in a warrior&#39;s light but clever in that of \nintelligence. Which was more of the way of winning a war and defeating an \nenemy then brute strength was. Through the years he had learned that little \ntid bit the hard way and on his old body he had worn the scars of it.\nDinobot shifted his weight slightly as he waited there along with the \nremainder of the Maximals which had come at the commanders call, feeling \nslightly out of place with the thought that it was all a waste of time and \nurging to be in the deftness of battle again. So indulged with the greed to \nget into the fight again, he had hardly noticed that Tavatron had made her \nway silently over to him and now stood beside. Though his attention was \ndrawn to her once her voice was registered to him, catching just faintly \nwhat she said. A growl forming on his voice the moment he opened his maw. **\n&quot; This battle was lost the moment the gestalts formed.&quot; ** his optics always \nremained on the battlefield and then enemy.** &quot; The only reaction remaining \nnow is to depart. There is nothing left here.&quot; ** Dinobot had heard Tavatron \nmention something about other wounded bots but that was worth less then a \nsingle bite of memory from his mental systems. Fore, he was not a team \nplayer and the deaths of the Maximals were none of his concern. All were \nnull except for one, Tavatron.\nAlready he could smell the stench of fresh mech-fluid dripping from her \nwounds, his already clotted. Since his repair his systems were functioning \nmuch faster. But Tavatron would need repairs, though none of the wounds \nseemed serious. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
