He took out his rifle and\npulled out his montrous blade.  With his energy rifle he shot 10 shots\nat the mutated IR.  At the same time he pointed his sword at IR and\nsueezed the hilt with a proper amount of pressure and the sword opened\nlike a mouth and shot one of two missiles designed by FireBlade. The\nmissile would explode once within 10 m of an enemy signature. All at\nonce in hte explosion would be an EMP blast plus liquid fire at 1000\nplus degress C.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., airly2000@y... wrote:\n&gt; Nightstrike:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Nightstrike to Megatron&quot; said the male using his comm link &quot;I locate\n&gt; the target but I need someone to cover me...
