Was this really the Carnage she had first met \nwhen she had come to this planet for her first time?\n\nA dagger of fear twisted itself in her gut. Carnage didn&#39;t want her \nas a friend? Well. She was going to say something to that!\n\nThe Fuzor began to follow her again, from a few meters distance, but \njust enough to let Carnage know that she was still keeping up.\n\n&quot;You think I&#39;m not Loyal? That I can be Trusted?&quot; She seethed. &quot;What \nabout in the time that we were here on Earth, the first time? Does \nthat mean NOTHING to you? If I wasn&#39;t a friend, don&#39;t you think I \nwould have joined the Maximals by now, instead of risking my life to \ncome here! I sought you out, tried to apologize, note the word TRIED, \nand you shove me off like I&#39;m some dirt underneath your foot? That \nI&#39;m not even worth considering?&quot;\n\nShe took a couple of deep breaths, eyes wide with her anger. &quot;If you \nwould learn to trust the right people, then you wouldn&#39;t be run all \nover! If I had of known you would be like this when I went away, then \nI never would have left! Back then, Carnage, you seemed like nothing \ncould ever knock you down..&quot;\n\nTeltoli&#39;s voice had quietened, and her ears drooped with sadness. \n&quot;You always seemed stronger than anyone I ever knew, even my Father. \nI looked up to you, and anyone that strong would have been able to \ncope&quot; She whispered, just loud enough.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m sorry that you think you get run over, but that doesn&#39;t mean \nthat I tried to trample all over you. I never did, and I never will&quot;\n\nHer anger had fizzeled out, for the most part. She never could stay \nangry at people, for long, anyway. Her next sentance had a tinge of \nanger in it, and her ears know lay flat against her head with \nannoyance.\n\n&quot;But fine, if you want to trample all over me in your haste to \ndestroy what could be the re-start of a great friendship, go ahead..&quot; \n\n\n"}}
