Liono tries to stab at \nMotormaster again.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDark Convoy fiddles with the settings of his gun for a moment, aiming \nit at Motormaster again. He fires three larger plasma blasts at the \nbot.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSeeing EndBringer taking on Koj, Killfest turns and boosts away from \nthe two bots, heading toward Dark Convoy and firing his EMP rifle.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nKoj smiles as EndBringer&#39;s electricity surges through him, his \ncircuits adapting and absorbing most of it. A normal bot would be \nfrying by now, but Koj had an ability to absorb energy. The Maximal \ntakes out his lance, jabbing it into EndBringer&#39;s stomach.\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., Robert Dahl &lt;rdahl@s...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Im asuming that you meant by dizzy is that his aim wont be so \ngood, If\n&gt; i&#39;m wrong tell me and I will correct this.\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; Motormaster delights in the sight of his enemy&#39;s strugle in his \niron grasp.\n&gt; Then with surprise on his face, he feels the edge of the sword nick \nhim,\n&gt; &quot;you&#39;re finished&quot; he cruely cackles, then his dark smile is \nreplaced by a\n&gt; look of pain, as his back starts to sizzle. &quot;Ohh, okkhh&quot; He is \nforced to\n&gt; loosen one of his hands.
