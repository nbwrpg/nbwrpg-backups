She looked to where the transmetal spider was \nstanding, Tarantulas.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Hell Beast pointed over to the alcove where the computers for \nthe engins, \n&gt; enviormental controls, and such, were located. &quot;He&#39;s there. Im sure \nyou two \n&gt; will get along nicely.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     Megatron moved onward, this time with a quickened pace. The \nbridge was 2 \n&gt; levels above them now. Because the lock down was in place, it would \nbe near \n&gt; impossible to get into any of the rooms. The corridor doors could \nbe forced \n&gt; open, but it took time. As for the shields, Megatron made sure that \nhe was \n&gt; closing a path behinde him, and opening a path before him. In case \nthey did \n&gt; stumble across the rebels, all he had to do was raise a shield. Of \ncourse, \n&gt; being an internal shield it would last only 10 minutes of crossfire \nbefore it \n&gt; gave way. Plenty of time in Megatrons mind to either stand ground \nor retreat.\n&gt;     &quot;Were almost thier. Nothing to worry about.&quot; Rampage said, his \nlarge \n&gt; triple missle launcher cast over his shoulder.\n\n\n"}}
