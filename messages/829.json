Release Wolfgang and put your gun down,&quot; FZ says sharply to Zardus, not noticing Nemesis, who was standing behind him.\n\nZardus opens his mouth to reply but FZ interrupts. &quot;Don&#39;t say anything. I know you can bring up the defences with one word. You move and you die, Zardus. I suggest you cooperate,&quot; FZ says with an evil gleam in his eyes.\n\n"}}
