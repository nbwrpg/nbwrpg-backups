There is no allience, there is no plot \nfor maximals and predacons to be friends. I have been through too \nmany battles and lost my base, my friends, my warriors and nearly my \nlife. I have faught too long to quit now. You maximals have been my \nenemies for too long. And no way in the pit will you convince me \nother wise.&quot;  She put her hand on her stomach and felt the empty \nspace in her internal compartment. &quot;However, I am not entirely un \naware of the conduct and care for of prisoners. Even when I had \nmaximals in my cells, they were treated very well. high class food, \nthier own quarters complete entertainment center complete with \nholodeck and left to be unharmed. Just they would be under heavy \nguard and not allowed to wander the ship. However, being at war, I \nwould still use the CR chambers to extract information. Or try to. \nYour command codes are impressively hard to crack. I will give you \nthat one, maximal.&quot;\n\nShe looked around and wondered when they would begin torturing her. \nShe knew it would eventually happen, just a matter of time. &quot;NOw \nthen, please feed me and show me to my cell. Even if it truely is in \nthe brigg.&quot;  SHe was trying to devise a way out. So far as she could \ntell, she could find the way out if she only made it to the hallway. \nHowever, there were now several bots blocking her way. She would have \nto bide her time and wait for her chance. \n\n&quot;Now then, back to feeding the prisoner, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Polar Claw &lt;cycodrone@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Shadowcaster heard the alarms and raced into the CR\n&gt; chamber- why was it that in a time of Peace, the\n&gt; Maximals still had their auto-defense system up and\n&gt; running?
