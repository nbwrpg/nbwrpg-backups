He knew he needed Rodimus not only as =\r\na comrade, but as a friend.  It was the one thing that Hydras didn&#39;t have a=\r\nnd a power he&#39;d never experience.  The power of friendship.  \n\n&quot; Hopefully =\r\nyou can hear me Rodimus.  I promise you as an Autobot and a Prime, that I w=\r\nill NEVER give up fighting unitl the day comes when the wars finally cease.=\r\n  After the wars, restoration is in order.  But if we&#39;re going to achieve t=\r\nhese goals, the leaders of the Autobots and the Maximals must come together=\r\n as a whole and only then can we restore order on this planet.  There&#39;s jus=\r\nt one problem, you&#39;ve slipped away on us, unintentionally of course, but wi=\r\nthout you we&#39;re not as powerful as we can be.  But with you we can give thi=\r\ns planet what it desperately needs, new hope and the promise of new life.  =\r\nNever give up your drive to restore order, for it&#39;s a drive that we all sha=\r\nre and treasure and a drive that no evil force can ever bring down.&quot;\n\nHe si=\r\nts up trying to get in a comfortable position.\n\n&quot; Then there&#39;s this little =\r\nmatter of Hydras..  Unfortunately he reminds me of good old Megatron and Ga=\r\nlvitron...  If we&#39;re going to overthrow him, we have to work together.  Tha=\r\nt won&#39;t be easy, but I know we can do it.  If anyone should be wanting to t=\r\nhwart him, it&#39;s you.  He did the most injustice to you, and by right, you h=\r\nave presidence as to how his fate should ultimately wind up.

Now, about \n&gt; &gt; Rodimus..  Looks like Tucson can&#39;t get t=\r\nhrough ta his radio &#39;cause it&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; off line. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap anaylizes=\r\n the tendrils.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s gotta have somethn&#39; ta do with those tendrils.=\r\n  But if we rip &#39;em \n&gt; &gt; off, we&#39;ll do more harm than good.

Oh \n&gt; &gt; yeah, that kinda did annoy Tucson a little bit, but other than=\r\n that, \n&gt; &gt; they&#39;re close.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rat Trap listens.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Okay then, m=\r\naybe if Wheels was here, talkn&#39; ta him, that might spark \n&gt; &gt; somethn&#39; with=\r\nout him havn&#39; ta give up his spark ta save &#39;em.
