We have also deteched close to 300 transformer signitures on \n&gt; the planet.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  There&#39;s no way ny brother could have beaten me here and gotten \nso \n&gt; many transformers in one place.\n&gt; \n&gt; C:  Not all read Maximal.  Some are Predicon, Autobot, \n&gt; Deciticon, Neutral, and some factions we&#39;ve never heard of.\n&gt; \n&gt; L looks at the ship on screen.\n&gt; \n&gt; L:  That&#39;s the Ark.

Transwarp is out  \n&gt; because of the Asteroid belt.  It could take months to estimate the \n&gt; right timing and directions.\n&gt; \n&gt; L: DANG! Oh well you said Predicons and Decipticons.  I&#39;m sure they \n&gt; can help.  Prepare the escape pod. And fire whatever weapons we have \n&gt; (just 4 small laser cannons) at that thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; He heads toward Eastern Asia.

Also rAuq \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; the only one I&#39;ve discussed this with (since I didn&#39;t need to \nunban \n&gt; &gt; anything just make sure it wasn&#39;t banned to start with), but he \nmay \n&gt; &gt; notice I changed a few details.  He&#39;ll start interacting when he \n&gt; gets \n&gt; &gt; to Earth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BIC:  A Pred lutient that looks like TT stands infront of a large \n&gt; &gt; tanker (not to be confused with tankor).  A green gas is pumped \ninto \n&gt; &gt; the holding area.  A general walks up to him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  You sure you want to fly this alone.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  So long as I&#39;m one step ahead of my brother whose to stop me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  Don&#39;t underestimate your brother.  If he thinks there&#39;s a \nchance \n&gt; &gt; to stop you he&#39;d fight even if it meant civilian casualties.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L: He has no idea where Earth is anyway.  It&#39;s not like he&#39;s just \n&gt; &gt; going to get lucky and crash there.  And what&#39;s so hard about \n&gt; getting \n&gt; &gt; into the orbit of a planet and dumping a biological weapon in \nthere \n&gt; &gt; atmosphere to wipe out all organic life and make sure the \n&gt; Decipticons \n&gt; &gt; win the great wars.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  You do realize you were a Maximal Protoform.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  The Autobot fight to  the death hero&#39;s on the Ark aren&#39;t \nrelated \n&gt; &gt; to me, and the ones back on Cybertron would hopefully surrender to \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; decipticons.  Me and my brother would be one big happy Pred family \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; our own time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  After seeing what this did to those Tranconians I have no \ndoubt \n&gt; &gt; this gas can do the job.  If something goes wrong just get into \nthe \n&gt; &gt; escape pod and land remember.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  What could go wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  I don&#39;t know.  They just teach us high up officers to say \nstuff \n&gt; &gt; like that if we want to be popular and to say fight to the death \nif \n&gt; we \n&gt; &gt; want to be remembered in history as that great General who sadly \n&gt; died \n&gt; &gt; young possibly in a Mutiny.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  Once there aren&#39;t any humans to back up the Autobots we win.  \n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s so hard about that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  Well when I visited Megatron in prison and he gave me this \n&gt; &gt; information it sounded like it had been pretty tough for him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  That was because of that Dinobot idiot.  After the tribes \n&gt; &gt; scattered he didn&#39;t have the weapons or tech to wipe them all out \nso \n&gt; &gt; he just went for the Ark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; G:  Well then you better be off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; L:  Goodbye.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He get&#39;s in and pilots it to Earth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC: I know I should have saved this a while longer, but I have a \n&gt; plan \n&gt; &gt; to keep the threat to Earth without carring it out.\n\n\n"}}
