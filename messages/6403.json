What the slag was Tigerhawk \nthinking?! That the alliance would just hand them over?! Now they had \nthree prisoners! Tavatron weakly clawed at the air, she didn&#39;t like \nbeing lifted in such a manner, it made her feel too helpless, too \nvulnerable. Tavatron&#39;s optics narrowed to slits as her eyes fell on \nthe flame thrower aimed at her face. \n\n*Just great* She thought with a hint of sarcasm, *I&#39;ve got a flame \nthrower in my face, Iron Raptor&#39;s losing fluid, fast, and we&#39;ve got a \n&#39;bot that&#39;s seen one too many &#39;damsels in distress&#39; movies trying to \nplay hero. This day just gets better and better.*\n\nTavatron sighed inwardly, the strain of her painful tranformaiton \nfinally taking it&#39;s toll on her. Her body began to go limp, her head \npartially resting against Pyro&#39;s gun. Mentally she was fine, but \nphysically she was tired, beaten, and in need of some serious R&R. \nTavatron searched the room with her eyes, finally resting her gaze on \nIron Raptor. She was unsure of her condition, but hopefully she would \nbe alright; she&#39;d taken a pretty nasty beating from those gaurds. \nTavatron snarled softly, why the slag had the Maximals sent Tigerhawk \non a suicide mission? If he continued to act in such a rash manner \nhe&#39;d get them killed! The last thing she wanted was to end up as a \npile of scrap metal!\n\n\n"}}
