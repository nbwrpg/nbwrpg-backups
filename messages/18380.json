It was still alive, and Starscream did not have it in \nhim to fight a helpless bot. He watched the fire on her die down, and \nthan placed her in the cockpit and sealed it tight, chaining her to \nthe seat. He would take her back to KitKat, and she would decide what \nto do with her. Maybe she knew where Megatron was. He would stop by \nthe base, put this rodent in custody, and than go and help Drillbit \ndefeat Inferno. He blasted of towards the base.\n\n\n"}}
