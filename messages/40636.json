Yahoo groups is \n&gt; slow at times with sending mail. Especially to hotmail at times and \n&gt; definately AOL all the time. Heh I havent recieved the below post \nby \n&gt; yan yet either. Thats why I check the group. Woot mesa got yelled \nat \n&gt; in the post too... woot.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Well heres the post:From:  Yanshosh@a...\n&gt; Date:  Sat Jul 21, 2001  2:28 am\n&gt; Subject:  End The !@#%ing OOCs\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; THAT IS ENOUGH!\n&gt; \n&gt; Out of the last 100+ posts, barely _10_ of them were IC. This is an \n&gt; RPG board,\n&gt; not a general discussion board. If you want to discus something, do \n&gt; it over\n&gt; private email or on the message board on the site.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know about other people, but I am sick as hell of the \n&gt; completely\n&gt; pointless OOCs on the RPG board. Lurker, you&#39;re a great RPer. Now \n&gt; shut up and\n&gt; take the compliment. Dewey, this is a BW RPG. The moment I see a \nchar \n&gt; with even\n&gt; a variation of &quot;Goku&quot; as his name, you&#39;ll regret it. In adition, \nstop \n&gt; moding.\n&gt; You can&#39;t make other people&#39;s chars do things, you never posted for \n&gt; Mustex even\n&gt; attempting to get on Alliance Island, much less getting on it, you \n&gt; have no part\n&gt; in the past of NBW, and can&#39;t change it at will. Your chars have no \n&gt; logical way\n&gt; of knowing about Zardus or Veratis, and its moding to have them \nhave \n&gt; that\n&gt; insight. Either explain how they know or drop that storyline. It \n&gt; makes no\n&gt; sence. Also, you never even landed that lowlife seller or whatever \nof \n&gt; yours on\n&gt; the planet, and I&#39;m not going to write your profiles for you. Shape \n&gt; up. Read\n&gt; the rules and act by them. LegendaryNemasis, please stop commenting \n&gt; on every\n&gt; post. The council will catch it if its moding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone else: stop the OOCs. Either write RPG posts, or don&#39;t post \n&gt; at all. I&#39;m\n&gt; very sick of coming home from work and reading through 100 or so \ndamn \n&gt; OOC\n&gt; posts. I&#39;m about ready to moderate anyone who sends an OOC ever \n&gt; again. I won&#39;t,\n&gt; but keep in mind that I&#39;m on the verge of turning into a very mean \n&gt; person.\n&gt; \n&gt; From now on, use private email for pointless OOCs, or use the \nsite&#39;s \n&gt; message\n&gt; board. DO NOT clog up space on this board. I&#39;m sick of it, as I \nsaid \n&gt; like 10\n&gt; times already in this post.\n&gt; \n&gt; There. I&#39;m through with my ranting. I really hope the OOC messages \n&gt; stop. Its\n&gt; very hard for me to keep up with posts as it is, and all this \n&gt; pointless crap is\n&gt; starting to convince me not to even bother.\n\n\n"}}
