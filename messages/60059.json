However, she couldn&#39;t move to save her life. She smiled \nslightly and looked at him. He was spiking her drinks and she was \njust now realizing it. She was mad at him for now her motor skills \nwent into stasis for a  bit. She took a deep breath and looked at \nhim. &quot;Malice, I like you. You are a good comrad in arms. However, you \never...and I mean EVER do that again, and once I can move again I&#39;ll \nterminate your programs perminantely.&quot; She couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. \nHe got the better side of her and she was more frustrated at herself \nfor letting her guard down.\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, robert riley &lt;bustercross365@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Malice chuckled.  He mixed up another drink for himself and \nWolfblade.  He added more energy and created an additional waveform.\n&gt; &lt;Let&#39;s see now, what system to target?  Hmm, nothing \ninterconnected.  I know!  Her minor motor control!  We&#39;ll see how \nbadly her eyes and tail twitch now!&gt;\n&gt; He introduced the waveform, added the energon, and put a little \nRussian Vodka in as a kicker.\n&gt; &quot;Dare to try?&quot;\n&gt; He downed his, with no problem, and watched Wolfblade with great \ninterest.\n&gt; \n&gt; shadowess_azogoth &lt;shadowess_azogoth@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; OOC: Disregard last post.

Let me \n&gt; please repost.\n&gt; \n&gt; IC:\n&gt; Wolfblade::\n&gt; She was starting to feel her legs again. Just to be sure, she stood \n&gt; up and and walked around the room. Her body was now normal. She sat \n&gt; back down and looked at the glass again. She drank it down and \n&gt; smiled. &quot;THat wasn&#39;t so.....&quot; Her smile disappeared as sparks lept \n&gt; from her neck and wrists. Her tail twitched wildly and her optics \n&gt; flashed wildly in various colors.  She twitched and sputtered a \nbit. \n&gt; After a few seconds, her body returned to normal. With a little \nmech \n&gt; fluid leaking from her nose and ears, she grinned. &quot;Ah, finally. \n&gt; something with a kick.&quot;  She looked at her empty glass. &quot;Got \nanother \n&gt; one?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yahoo!
