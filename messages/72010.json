Location\n=\r\n&gt; of Tarantulus.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a short pause before it replied. &quot;Tarantul=\r\nus is located in\n&gt; cargo bay four.&quot;  SKY SHADOW chuckled wickedly. &quot;Ahhh, c=\r\nargo bay four.\n&gt; I thought he had something going on down there.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; MEAN=\r\nWHILE IN CARGO BAY 4:\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTULUS stood in the darkness for a moment as=\r\n a previously hidden\n&gt; door slid open revealing a dimly lit chamber of some=\r\n sort inside.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahhh yes my sweet.&quot; TARANTULUS said as he stepped insid=\r\ne and looked\n&gt; almost lovingly at a modified CR chamber in the middile of t=\r\nhe room.\n&gt; All sorts of cables and tubes were running to it and it looked t=\r\no be\n&gt; in a count down.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rest of the room was a mish mash of comput=\r\ner and machinery parts\n&gt; that lined the shelves. Spare diodes and servos wh=\r\nere placed on\n&gt; shelves along the wall on one side, while on the other was =\r\na large\n&gt; computer work station that looked as if it had been cobbled toget=\r\nher.\n&gt; Part of it had cables that were running to the CR chamber in the roo=\r\nm.\n&gt; \n&gt; TARANTULUS cackled to himself as the timer on the CR chamber was\n&gt; =\r\nfinishing its count down and then finally beeped indicating it was\n&gt; &#39;done&#39;=\r\n. With a deft movement he pressed a button on a nearby console\n&gt; and the do=\r\nor of the chamber hissed and clicked and slowly began to\n&gt; open.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Awak=\r\nen my sweet.&quot; TARANTULUS said as he waited for the result. &quot;Return to me.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&lt;NEW - BLACKARACHNIA&gt;\n\nThere was a sizzle and then a spark as the stasi=\r\ns pod that the femme Predacon then Maximal now Predacon again sparked back =\r\nto life.  It slowly swooshing open as the purple and black femmecon came on=\r\nline, her systems powering up then, the yellow PREDACON symbol upon her col=\r\nlar glowing as the final restiges of her reprogramming kicked in as her sys=\r\ntems resynced and rebooted.\n\nHer coming out of the tube, slowly turning aru=\r\nond to face TARANTALUS.  The dark colored WIDOW looking over at TARANTALUS,=\r\n as BLACKARACHIA&#39;s core consciousness accepted it&#39;s new status.\n\nRight as s=\r\nhe would face him, whispering, &quot;What are your instructions, my master?&quot;  Wo=\r\nrds that were said so softly to send a jolt through his servos.  As if she =\r\nwere readying to suck him dry of his fuel cells after mesmerizing him.\n\n\n"}}
