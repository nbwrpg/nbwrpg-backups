Since the mouse was back, she \nfigured that she could go out.  She ran out of the base in wolf mode \nand headed into the woods.  She ran though the forest with ease.  it \nfelt great to be free running again.  She kept running untill she \ncame to an abrupt stop.  She smelled something.  She sniffed the air \nagain.  Wolves, she thought.  She could smell other wolves about.  \nShe couldn&#39;t tell if they were bot or not, the scent was too faint.  \nBut deniably wolf.  She followed her nose through the trees hoping to \nfind them.  If they were a real pack, she might try to join them for \na while.  She needed to be with a real pack again.  Her instinct for \nbeing in a pack were strong.  She had survived for a long time as a \nsingle wolf.  But she yurned to be in a pack again.\n\n\n"}}
