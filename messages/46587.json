Boy, I&#39;m glad there&#39;s a \n=\r\nbunch of you nice folks up here=85 Last time I joined a game, people \nall t=\r\nried to kill me off right away. Not that I don&#39;t expect some \ncombat=85o_O;=\r\n;\n\n(IC)\nSkullhammer&#39;s huge, grey form thundered across the plains of the \nA=\r\nfrican region. His large padded feet crashed along the ground at a \ngreat p=\r\nace, striking up a cloud of dust which encircled and trailed \nafter him lik=\r\ne a tsunami. Powerful robotic legs pushed him onwards \ntowards the base, hi=\r\ns newly formed beast mode speeding nearer and \nnearer. \n\nHis robotic mind, =\r\na network of circuitry and uplink servo-chips, \naccepted an incoming messag=\r\ne clearly across the rapidly lessening \ndistance between himself and the Au=\r\ntobot base. As he heard the voice \nand verification of being an Autobot, hi=\r\ns tense steel muscles \nrelaxed, and he continued on his pace. Amongst the h=\r\neavy footfalls of \nhis massive elephant form, Skullhammer made his reply wi=\r\nth a high \nheart=85er, spark.\n\n&quot;Greetings Autobot Commander Pacifix. This i=\r\ns Maximal Infantry \nSkullhammer, approaching your base&#39;s eastern side. I&#39;ve=\r\n just landed \non this planet. Most of my own sensors are offline yet.&quot; His =\r\nvoice, \nmade up of a deep and even tonality in line with his large body, wa=\r\ns \nclear even above the loud rumbling his four strong legs made as he \nrush=\r\ned across the barren region.\n\nSkullhammer&#39;s pace quickened, shocking even h=\r\nim. The corded steel \nmuscles of the Maximal warrior flexed underneath the =\r\npseudo-skin \nwhich covered him, propelling him along at speeds he didn&#39;t th=\r\nink \npossible for the somewhat unwieldy and sizeable form which he \ninhabit=\r\ned. His weighty body came closer and closer to the base until \nhe was less =\r\nthan fifty meters. \n\nWell inside the range of the base&#39;s autocannons, Skull=\r\nhammer skidded \nto a halt on a small stone ridge. The base was clearly an A=\r\nutobot \nsite, and was furthermore armed to the teeth, ready to unload a \npo=\r\nwerful and violent volley of blasts upon his metallic hide. He \ncould almos=\r\nt picture the barrage of energy bolts and hot projectile \nfire being fired =\r\nin a terrifying storm of death, and himself being \nstuck right in the cente=\r\nr of it, if he were to make a wrong move or \ncome under suspicion. His life=\r\n as an Autobot told him the procedures \nAutobots followed.\n\nSpeaking direct=\r\nly to the base now, closer in range, Skullhammer \nraised his voice in a cle=\r\nar opening statement. &quot;Autobots, I am \nSkullhammer, an Autobot of Cybertron=\r\n sent to assist the Maximals in \ntheir mission here on Earth against the Pr=\r\nedacon forces.&quot;\n\n\n\n"}}
