All she was trying to do was end the battle and now he \nwas calling her weak?!\nShe felt like wringing his neck! But she knew that she couldn&#39;t, and since \nshe couldn&#39;t she wouldn.t*\n\n&quot; So trying to save a Maximal is weak?&quot; she said over the comm to Angel \nPrime only. &quot; Let me tell you something! It takes more then guts and will to \nfight to make a leader. You may think I&#39;m weak and you&#39;re welcome to your \nown opinion. And if you&#39;re not happy then you are welcome to leave! But as \nlong as I&#39;m commander we&#39;ll fight for peace and not bloodshed.&quot;\n\n* She closed her com to Angel Prime and opened it to the remainder of the \nMaximals.*\n\n&quot; Maximals. Obviously you heard the chindish antics of a certain Maximal \nthat has war on the brain. I know you don&#39;t like this and neither do I, but \nI don&#39;t want the death of Chordate on our hands. I&#39;ve tried to be paitent \nand I&#39;m sorry if this upsets you. I&#39;ve tried.&quot;\n\n* Iron Raptor then sighed and closed the comm. She turned towards the \nMaximals that were around her. Giving them a look which spoke that she was \ncompletely lost. &lt; All I did was try and do something right, and I get \nyelled at.&gt; she thought.\nIron Raptor turned towards FZ.*\n\n&quot; You can have the prisiners. But in exchange for Chordate. We&#39;ll do the \nexchange in an hour in neutral territory. If your Alliance leaves the \nMaximals won&#39;t follow. The battle will be over.&quot;\n\n* Iron Rapto leaned back.\nWhy did the Maximals do this? Why did they have to be so cruel?  All she had \ntried to do was save someone. Now she was sure that most of them hated her. \nJust because she had done something to try and make things better.\nDeep inside a slight depression sank in, nothing that showed on the outside \nbut a side to her that said that it wasn&#39;t worth fighting with, but another \nside that told her to keep going. And that was the side she would listen to.\nNow it was up to the Alliance to accept her new offer.\nBut she still had hope that the Maximals would listen, even if it was for a \nsecond. They weren&#39;t bad, just eager to win.\nShe wanted to win too, but it was already too late and a victory wouldn&#39;t be \ntoday.\nBut she had plans, she was biding her time now.\nSoom, the enemies of the Maximals would quiver at the name.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
