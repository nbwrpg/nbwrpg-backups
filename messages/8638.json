A few were panicked and battled ready, and others were in a desperate cry for help. He listened in. From what she was receiving, they were Predacon, like her. He perked up her ears and looked forward. They were near-by.

He ran towards their position. \n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I&#39;m coming! &lt;/EM&gt;she called to them. &lt;EM&gt;I&#39;m with you! I&#39;m coming!&lt;/EM&gt; \n&lt;P&gt;She galloped to the edge of the forest and imaged herself to a group of running bots: a black, stocky horse.
