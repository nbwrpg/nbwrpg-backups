She slithered around and found the mess hall. \nShe \n&gt; pushed out the vent over and jumped down, she transformed into bot \n&gt; mode in mid air and landed on her feet.  She hissed and tasted the \n&gt; air around her.  She kew these bots would be on alert for her.  She \n&gt; saw that the mess hall was empty and walked to the door. She poked \n&gt; her head around and saw that the halleay was vacant.  She\ncausiously \n&gt; walked down the hall, not making a sound.  She had her pistol drawn \n&gt; and readied.  She stopped and looked around, still no one.  She\nkept \n&gt; walking.  She ahd no idea that she was actually heading for the \n&gt; bridge o\n\n\n"}}
