Giggling paper?

She knew she could read and project\n&gt; thoughts.\n&gt; &gt; But she wondered if she could do anything else.  She looked around\n&gt; &gt; the lab for a small object. The clipboard near Veratis would work.\n&gt; &gt; She closed her eyes and saw the clipboard in her mind. Then she\n&gt; &gt; openend her eyes and stared at the clipboard. She concentrated with\n&gt; &gt; all her strength. She tried to move the clipboard.  But it didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; move. She tried again. It still didn&#39;t move. She sighed and\n&gt; wondered\n&gt; &gt; if she was trying to pick up something too heavy. She looked at a\n&gt; &gt; sheet of paper on the console. She closed her eyes and envisioned\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; paper in her mind. Then she opened her eyes and looked at the\n&gt; paper.\n&gt; &gt; She focused her mind and envisioned an invisible hand, reaching out\n&gt; &gt; from her mind and grabbing the paper. Then she envisioned the paper\n&gt; &gt; being lifted up off the console. The paper giggled a little, then\n&gt; &gt; lifted off the console an inch. She smiled, but in doing so, it\n&gt; broke\n&gt; &gt; her concentratin and the paper fell down onto the console, then\n&gt; slid\n&gt; &gt; off and onto the floor. &quot;Oh darn, almost had it too.&quot; she said\n&gt; loud,\n&gt; &gt; not worrying if Veratis heard her or not.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
