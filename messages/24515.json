In the midst of the fight \none of the masquitos landed on apocalypse. Suked out some of his dna and flew \noff. It would be only felt as a masquito bite. Another landed on killfest. \nBiting into him. So small doubt it could be felt. The two masqutios flew off \nback to the spot of thier master. Another masquito landed on the back of \nZardus. Took a small sample and flew off quickly. To short of time for most \nbots to tell. Another masquito landed on the back of  Dark Mouse. Takeing its \nsample and flying off. It would only  be known as a bothering insect.   One \nmore insect flew and landed on top of the bot known as cerberus. It had used \nits digging abilitys though small to dig a minature hole under the shields. \nSo small doubtful that a autogun would target a small creature. It took its \nsample and left. The bots headed to thier new home. The two bots they needed \nlast would be obtained later. For now this would be enough to start thier \nmaster&#39;s first evolution.\n\n"}}
