With a quiet clang, the plate is set on top of the rest \nof them. \n\nHe walks back to the rest of the plates, &quot;Jetstorm, what is the \nchance of us doing battle during this mission?&quot; He lifts another \nplate, and places it on top of the pile.

It certaintly appeared to be so.\n\nRemembering that Artemis was going on a recruiting mission, he gets \nup exits his quarters. &quot;Hoist.&quot; he says, and a hologram of Hoist \nappears beside him, as he trudges through the halls, only a few more \nturns to the control room. &quot;Hoist, I patch me through to Artemis. \nI&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s out of comm range.\n\nThe holographic Hoist nods, &quot;Alrighty Pacifix.&quot; He flickers for a \nsec, then speaks again, &quot;Alright, you&#39;re good to go.&quot;\n\nPacifix nods, &quot;Alright. Artemis, can you hear me? This is Pacifix. \nWhat is your status with this new bot, and what have you learned of \nhim?\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;warriorazure&quot; &lt;wingedwarrior41@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Jetstorm: Let&#39;s just take it out of here.
