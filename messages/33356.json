Then he sees Cepta for the first time. &quot;Hmmm, new parts,\n&gt; &gt; who&#39;re you?&quot; his eyes narrow and flash green then return to normal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On 27 Apr 2001, at 21:58, Soulstice Omega wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squawktalk, listening to Megatron, flies to Cepta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Squawktalk: Hello, hello, you want the tour, right? Of course \nyou do!\n&gt; Okay! Anyway, first of all, this is the main chamber, it serves \nwell because\n&gt; it&#39;s main. It&#39;s where you are when you first walk in, it&#39;s where \nyou are\n&gt; when you see the door! It&#39;s where we go sometime to leave the base, \nit&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; also where we go after we come in! It&#39;s got all these cool \ncomputers and\n&gt; stuff, and tables and that and it&#39;s where we are right now! Isn&#39;t \nthat a\n&gt; coincidence? Well, anyway, it&#39;s a nice room maybe a little too \ndusty but\n&gt; then again maybe not and it&#39;s a good room because it has lots of \nroom, and\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; leads into all of the other rooms, it&#39;s also one of the biggest \nrooms,\n&gt; which is good, because everyone might try to come in at the same \ntime, and\n&gt; if they do and the room is really tiny then everyone will be \ncrowded and the\n&gt; base might explode. Also, it&#39;s big because something might happen \nlike\n&gt; &gt; someone breaks in, and there might be a shootout and everyone \nwill get\n&gt; shot if there isn&#39;t much room, did I mention that? I don&#39;t think I \ndid,\n&gt; correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I know I&#39;m not wrong because I&#39;m \nright. Anyway,\n&gt; I&#39;m Squawktalk and you are? I mean what&#39;s your name, I&#39;m not \ncalling you\n&gt; &gt; Squawktalk, that would be silly, wouldn&#39;t it? I hope you have a \nnice name,\n&gt; you probably do, but I still hope, because hoping can get you stuff\n&gt; sometimes, and anyway, it&#39;s fun, so about your name, it should be \nnice\n&gt; because my name is cool and I met you, didn&#39;t I? Anyhow, what I was \ntrying\n&gt; to say\n&gt; &gt; is that maybe we&#39;ve spent too long in this room, want to go to \nthe next\n&gt; room? It would be good because then we won&#39;t be in this room and \nwe&#39;ll be in\n&gt; the next one instead and I can talk to you in there just hurry up \nand don&#39;t\n&gt; take forever, okay?...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
