Quickly it shifted form and looked upward, its form and \nvisag=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; disturbingly familiar to those who know their history. The \ncyclopean=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; gaze, the right arm sporting dual mounted cannons, the left arm \nthat\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; IS a cannon. Despite the color changes it looked like \nSHOCKBLAST!! \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who ever it is, it stood below them, and began to fire upwards at \nt=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; incoming minion!\n&gt; \n&gt; Quickly the remaining three minions scatter!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Phobia shoots into the air and rolls to one side flying protectivly\n&gt; o=\r\nver where Deepstryke fell, her movements swift and sure, but there \nis\n&gt; a =\r\nslight note of panic in them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Tumult and Decibel on the other hand str=\r\neak in flying right at the\n&gt; black and crimson figure, a full spread of mis=\r\nsiles launching from \neach\n&gt; of them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thier missiles land with stupif=\r\nying power and the ground cracks as\n&gt; multiple explosions pit thier force a=\r\ngainst it.  Yet out of the fire\n&gt; and smoke the black tank moves seeming on=\r\nly a little worse for \nwear. A\n&gt; few dents seem to crack its once perfect s=\r\nhell, but it niether \nslows no\n&gt; stops its own awesome assult. \n&gt; \n&gt; A rear=\r\n mounted turret spun and oriented on Decibel as twin searing\n&gt; beams cut th=\r\nrough the air and into her rear stabilizer struts, she\n&gt; cried out agony!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Meanwhile the main cannon lined up on Tummult and disgorged an \nenergy\n=\r\n&gt; blast that seemed to heat the air as it passed! The flier was a \nlittle\n&gt;=\r\n too nimble for the new commer and was able to evade it, just \nbarely. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Who are you?&quot; Phobia&#39;s powerful voice spoke dangerously from her\n&gt; prote=\r\nctive postion over Deepstryke. &quot;You attack us at your peril!&quot; \nShe\n&gt; was wo=\r\nrried, her scanners were picking up niether Predicon or \nMaximal\n&gt; signatur=\r\nes. She assumed robot mode her cannons ready to fire!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I AM LEGACY . .=\r\n . &quot; Came the cold reply from below, &quot; . . . AND \nYOU DO\n&gt; NOT POSSESS THE =\r\nPOWER TO DEFEAT ME.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You are wrong!&quot; Phobia let loose with a powerful=\r\n wave of energy\n&gt; blasts, designed destabilize ones fear centers. &quot;FEAR ME!=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The blast hit the newcommer, the one revealed as Legacy near dead\n&gt; =\r\ncenter, and he didn&#39;t slow. &quot;FEAR IS IRRELIVENT. YOU ARE AN \nABNORMALITY\n&gt; =\r\nAND YOU WILL BE TERMINATED!&quot; The cold and relentless voice spoke \nfrom\n&gt; be=\r\nlow. \n&gt; \n&gt; Cannon blasts from Legacy drove Phobia to look for cover as they=\r\n \ncame\n&gt; dangerously close to shering off her shoulders!\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: I am not=\r\n sure what Darkfate or Nightstrike are doing, so I\n&gt; couldn&#39;t post a respon=\r\nse to them. \n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Also I am sure if the Maxi&#39;s are approaching they sh=\r\nould \nclearly\n&gt; be able to see the battle. Deepstryke&#39;s down, Phobia&#39;s prot=\r\necting \nhim,\n&gt; Tumult and Decibel is in the thick of fighting a black and r=\r\ned\n&gt; futuristic hover tank of good size.
