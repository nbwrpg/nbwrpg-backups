Dark One, followed by his four Oblitercons stepped up.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Welcome, Dark One.&quot; Vehement said with a smile.  Slag. Vehement \nthought.  \n&gt; There would be no way to know his name if I just arrived on the \nplanet! \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;How do you know my name?&quot; the leader of the Oblitercons asked, \nturning to \n&gt; his troops.  &quot;Head back to base, except for Sixshot, Ares, and \nDouble Punch.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The orders were followed out as the troops headed off.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Now answer my question.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Dark one is your name?  That&#39;s somewhat amusing.  I merely \nmeant &#39;dark one&#39; \n&gt; as in the color of your body.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Oh, who are you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Vehement.  Leader of this ship.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am Dark One.  A soldier in the Alliance,&quot; Dark One said, though \nhe was \n&gt; really just a mercenary, &quot;the leader of the Alliance is Zardus.  He \nis not \n&gt; here though.  He usually leads all major attacks personally, but we \nmoved our \n&gt; base, so he is needed with our bases.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;So, that is your base on the island.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...yes.&quot; Dark One hesitated.  &quot;What did that blasted KitKat want \nwith you?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;She wanted me to ally with her.  But now it seems she&#39;s much to \nweak to \n&gt; protect my forces if we got in a battle.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Heh.  Can&#39;t protect yourselves?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;The robots you see in front of you are all that remain of us.  We \ngot in a \n&gt; battle with three Maximal strike cruisers, and the rest were killed \nin the \n&gt; crash.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Blasted Maximals.  So, why should I let you live?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Though we have little cannon fodder value, we can produce energon \nfrom solar \n&gt; technology.  And weapons, and our base is quite strong.  With three \nbases at \n&gt; your disposal.  Though, I&#39;d like to remain neutral.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Interesting...I&#39;ll have to contact our leader.&quot; Dark One activated \nhis comm. \n&gt; unit, setting the frequency to the inner monologue comm. unit in \nZardus&#39; head.\n&gt; &quot;Zardus, Dark One here.  KitKat&#39;s pathetic forces have retreated.  \nThe leader \n&gt; of the base we are at, Vehement, wishes to discuss a peace treaty \nwith us.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
