He wasn&#39;t going to go any further than the first set \nof trees. He looked around. He could smell Rowdy Wolf. His flute \nplaying had stopped. \n\n\nTerrorsaur saw a figure below. It was a big figure, heavy shouldered. \nHe transformed to robot mode and lowered down to it. It was Rowdy \nWolf, but something was different. \n\nRowdy Wolf turned his head to Terrorsaur and stared at him coldly. On \nthe side of his face, there was a plate of mismatching metal attached \nto it, like someone wiht a bad skill in repairing. There was also a \nmess of metal parts on his left arm. \n\n&quot;Rowdy Wolf?&quot; Terrorsaur said, studying Rowdy Wolf. &quot;What happened?&quot;\n\n&quot;I stayed,&quot; he replied. &quot;I risked my life for you.&quot;\n\nTerrorsaur squinted. There was something in the air, and it didn&#39;t \nfeel right. \n\n&quot;Well, are you damaged?&quot; he asked.\n\nRowdy Wolf pulled his arm up, armed with his rifle. &quot;Where is \nQuickstrike?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Terrorsaur replied. &quot;I think he&#39;s dead. You see, \nthere was a battle and he was possible caught.&quot;\n\nRowdy Wolf eyed him for a short while. &quot;Tell Megatron I want to speak \nto him.&quot;\n\n&quot;I can show you to him,&quot; Terrorsaur commented. \n\n&quot;Bring him here!&quot; Rowdy Wolf shouted, then fired.\n\n\n\n\nMegatron lifted his head, hearing a shot. There was silence a few \nseconds after, then another shot. It sounded like Terrorsaur&#39;s marks. \nThere was another moment of silence. \n\nHe looked around. He saw something falling towards him. It was a \nbright. Within the moment, he saw it was Terrorsaur. His metal body \nslammed into the ground and slid past KitKat and himself. There was \nheavy damage to his shoulder.\n\n&quot;He wants to talk to you,&quot; Terrorsaur said to Megatron, only lifting \nhis head.\n\n\n"}}
