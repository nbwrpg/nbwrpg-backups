Be back in 5 hours or so.\n\n::Slayer/Kluster/Firearm::\n\nSlayer nods.\n\n&quot;It will be done,&quot; he says, flying toward Lunarpine, his gun ready.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFirearm lands at the Cybertronian Fire, passing the shields and \nholding onto Spears tightly. If she woke up and ran off, it wouldn&#39;t \nbe too good.\n\nHe enters, raising an eyebrow when he sees Kluster standing with a \nwheeled pallet behind him. The pallet had reinforced arm leg, and \nhead straps, and had a strange device above the &quot;pillow&quot;.\n\n&quot;Most of the crew are out on missions, so I&#39;m stuck with the fetching \njobs,&quot; Kluster explains as Firearm puts Spears on the pallet, &quot;That \ndevice will block out transmissions and also acts as a scan jammer.&quot;\n\nFirearm looks at Kluster like the bot had finally snapped. &quot;Sir, I \nhave been on this ship for a while now, I&#39;m not one of the new \nMaximals.&quot;\n\nKluster smiles, realizing he had been explaining something to Firearm \nthat Firearm probably knew everything there was to know about. \n&quot;Sorry, hosting a factions isn&#39;t exactly easy on the nerves, you \nknow.&quot;\n\nFirearm nods, moving the pallet and heading over toward the lab with \nit. &quot;Do you know if we have a bot specialist on this ship, sir? My \nknowledge of surgery and reprogramming might not be enough for this. \nIts pretty limited.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, minime_316@h... wrote:\n&gt; Trainers\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right, it&#39;s game time,&quot; said Prebon, &quot;Slayer, you start us \noff. \n&gt; Stay in cloak and hunt down the wolf. As soon as you open fire on \n&gt; him, we will attack the Ark. I think we will stay in cloak, and it \n&gt; will make them confused and by Blaze more time. Okay Slayer. Time \nto \n&gt; prove yourself. Destroy that wolf bot!&quot;\n\n\n"}}
