There must be something here. Find it!&quot;\n\nThe other figures spread out and began a methodical search of the\nterrain, booted feet trampling down the vegetation as they searched. \n\n&quot;I&#39;m only picking up residual energy readings.&quot; Phobia said, the red\nand black armored female in almost disgusted tones. &quot;There&#39;s nothing\nhere.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t be too quick.&quot; Tumult chimed in from his search. &quot;I found a bit\nof discarded armor here.&quot; He picked up a small bit of metal. &quot;It looks\nlike it is Unicronian. Must be Blacknightmare&#39;s&quot; He frowned.\n\n&quot;This is all a pile of RUST!&quot; Decibel grumbles from her position. &quot;We\nshould be cracking some aftplates, not rumbling around in the bush of\nthis ball of dirt.&quot;\n\nDeepstryke glanced over at Decibel, but as she was still working, saw\nno need to chastise her at the moment. There would be time enough for\nher abilities to be put to the test. \n\n&quot;What about this?&quot; Phobia picked up a piece of armor from the ground.\n&quot;It looks Predacon ... &quot; She flipped it over in her hands expertly. &quot;\n.. a piece of a shoulder module.&quot; \n\nDeepstryke nodded as he looked around, &quot;Yes, there was something more.&quot;\nHe looked over at the area, &quot;Search there and there.&quot; He directed his\nsubordinates.\n\nTumult fanned out in search. &quot;I can see where they crouched in\npreparation for combat, but no shells casing or scorch marks from\nfiring. &quot;They must have held fire for some reason.&quot;\n\nDeepstryke stepped over to examine the unmistakable imprint of a\nshuttle. &quot;Predacon armor, a standoff? Must have been Maximals and\nPredacons.&quot; he continued to look around. He pointed, &quot;Someone was\nstanding here .. the focal point of at least part of this scenario, and\nhe walked from that way.&quot; He pointed back to where the rest were\nstanding.  \n\nPhobia nodded as she searched, &quot;I can see where one of them was\ncrouched to attack the one at the focal point. She grunted in derision,\n&quot;Probably a Predacon.&quot;\n\nNightrazor appeared from seemingly nowhere. His face was firm and\nresolved as he squatted to look at the prints.  &quot;There was another,\nsomewhat lighter.&quot; he followed the steps around, scanning the\nunderbrush. &quot;Everything is a little old now, but from the looks of\nthings these two stood off the others and &#39;rescued&#39; Blacknightmare.&quot;\nNightrazor paused and examined the ground carefully, &quot;The first one\nstood off a group of others while a second one lifted Blacknightmare\noff the ground.&quot; Nightrazor looked around, �This feels like Maximals,\nPredacons are not for standing off an obviously superior foe, they\nwould rather run.\n\n�Nor endangering their lives for another.� Phobia chimed in.\n\nDeepstryke nodded, �It would have to be a bot of power or charisma to\nstand-off Predacons.�\n\n�Rodimus Prime?� Decibel bellowed\n\n�I can�t tell.� Nightrazor�s voice was thoughtful as he looked around.\nHe was probably the most skilled of the team to read these marks and\nyet he couldn�t get a complete picture. �I haven�t seen any missile\nstrikes and just from prints I can only get general weight and\nmovements.� He frowned.\n\nTumult grunted, �Only a few shell casing. They didn�t fire all that\nmuch, but when they did they were using predominantly energy weapons.\nBut I have to agree. I would bet my last credit that this was a Maximal\nstandoff, and they won.�\n\nDeepstryke nodded, �To the air then Minions We have what we can get\nhere! We have a new target! The Maximals!�\n\nThe rest of the figures leaped into the air, shifted form and along\nwith deepstryke disappeared into the skies!\n\nPreston\n(Da&#39;minion)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nBe a better friend, newshound, and \nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
