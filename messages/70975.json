He knew he had to stick to his words, and he=\r\n too, realizes that now was not the time to keep on fighting.  A life depen=\r\nded on his actions.  So in his keeping of honor, he signals all Autobots an=\r\nd Maximals to do what he felt was the right thing.\n\n&quot;Attention all Autobots=\r\n and Maximals.  Although we fought bravely, and the intent was of the heart=\r\n, I feel that this time, we must submit to the demands of the being who is =\r\nholding the life of our comrade hostage.  Therefore, I ask all of you to ce=\r\nase fire, and fall back.  If something adverse comes of this, I will person=\r\nally hold myself responsible for whatever happens next.  I thank each and e=\r\nvery one of you for your support and compassion.  But now, we must surrende=\r\nr for it is the life of our comrade, Nightlight, that holds in the balance.=\r\n&quot;\n\nNight Shift subspaces his weapon, as Straight Shot transforms into her r=\r\nobot mode, disarming her own weaponry as well.  \n\n&quot;You did a great job Kup.=\r\n  I&#39;m sorry, but I gotta follow orders.  Tucson&#39;s right.  Sometimes, winnin=\r\ng the battle isn&#39;t the most important thing.&quot;\n\nNight Shift nodds.\n\n&quot;I secon=\r\nd that.  So, what do we gotta do in order ta save Nightlight?&quot;\n\nTucson look=\r\ns to Nightshift and nodds as well.\n\n&quot;I second that question.  Tell us, what=\r\n must we do in order to ensure the saftey of our comrade?  We will retreat,=\r\n as you demand, only if you keep your end of the bargain.&quot;\n\nHe still holds =\r\na resolute expression on his face.  Tucson was ready for anything, but now =\r\nhis own stability could possibly be tested this day.\n\nBack at the Ark, Quic=\r\nkstride was also becoming highly suspicious as to what was happening.  He k=\r\nnew now that he had to try and keep in touch with Stanton and the others, i=\r\nnside the Ark.  He now resorts to his com link.\n\n&quot;Quickstride ta Stanton, o=\r\nver, what&#39;s gon&#39; on in there?  I&#39;m not likn&#39; thiis.  Maaan, I wish Uproar w=\r\nas still around....

She will\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; restart in ten seconds.&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Came the cold voice of Legacy. It could be clearly heard in the ea=\r\nrs of everyone, his voice amplified in some strange way. Even to the warrio=\r\nrs on the battle field this voice was sent! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;5 seconds . . . 3 s=\r\neconds . . .&quot; Legacy called out in his cold \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; timeless voice. &quot; 2 . .=\r\n 1 . . .\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; *KUTCHUNK*\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; That noise, the sound off all po=\r\nwer being cut could not be mistaken for anything else as it too transmitted=\r\n distinctly over the radio!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Scrap!&quot; Santon said somewhere in the=\r\n darkness.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This was followed by silence, and then . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Turn HER ON!!!!!&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was Perceptor&#39;s voice, the anger in it al=\r\nmost poignant as if coming from deep within his spark. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;You&#39;re m=\r\nurdering her!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Those last words echoing . . . \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&quot;murder=\r\ning her!!!!!&quot;    &gt;&quot;murdering her!!!!!&quot;   &gt;&quot;murdering her!!!!!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; A ra=\r\nspy laugh came over the radio, playing to all the combatants at or near Bla=\r\nck Tower. It was a voice that was clearly unused to speaking. A dark voice,=\r\n one built seemingly from the shadows themselves. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Maximals, Autobo=\r\nts, &quot;If you wish to save your companion you will lay down your weapons, Now=\r\n!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Inside the Ark a small light came on over Nightlight&#39;s bed as a =\r\nsmall trickle of power was restored to her.
