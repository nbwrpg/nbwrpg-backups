A \n&gt; reborn Decepticon remained ever vigilant and observant of all that \n&gt; happened... from afar. Eager to surprise some of the occupants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Crimson optics flashed upon receiving data that her old opponent and \n&gt; archrival Elita-One still functioned... and was here upon this very world. \n&gt; A deep animal-metallic gurgle-growl eminated from her as she took note of \n&gt; the last location of Elita.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So,&quot; she began softly. &quot;You&#39;ve managed to escape the throws of the Abyss, \n&gt; have you.&quot; Baring her razored metallic teeth, &quot;Not for long, to be sure of \n&gt; that!&quot; she hissed maliciously.\n&gt;\n&gt; A clawed finger touched another &#39;button&#39; on the console and another \n&gt; holographic visual appeared of Hydras&#39; signature and signatures of others \n&gt; before they faded out in some vast area of the unknown. A dangerous area.\n&gt; &quot;Hmmm,&quot; tapping and typing, still nothing seemed to work. But there was \n&gt; one hint, so very tiny and barely readable of some signature for but a \n&gt; split moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; It appeared she will have to make herself known soon enough. Surprise her \n&gt; former allies and enemies. No one would expect her return.\n&gt; And so, she powered up on an alternative energon that was derived from \n&gt; geo-thermal energy. It was not a delightful as the Cybertronian version, \n&gt; but it would serve it&#39;s purpose very well and was more than tolerable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once powered up now at full power, she exited the compound, with or \n&gt; without MegatronX&#39;s permission. It was time to make her presence here \n&gt; known.\n&gt; Leaping off a ledge she transformed into a massively majestic Cybertronian \n&gt; vessel of destruction... and took to the sky.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
