His small sphereical body floats in \nfront of the fuzors face ::: You will tell me the codes! Once I have the \ncodes we can take control of the ship, and squash that damn spider!\n\n::: Nervously he jets over to Shredder ::: If you dont hand over the codes, I \nwill order Shredder to....cause you pain like you have never experienced \nbefore!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: HELL BEAST reads the message. After a few hours they had finally broken \nthe code :::\n\n::: BLACK ARACNIA ::: So, Ol&#39; bug face has hired the Oblitercons to escourt \nQuickstrike here....and Megatron is still alive.\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: Yes....this is quite disturbing indeed. We will begin to \nfortify the base at once. Call Mosquitor, Inferno, Rampage, and Tankkor. This \nbase will not fall into enemy hands.\n\n::: PHENIOX looked to him ::: And what of Transanulas?\n\n::: HELL BEAST ::: We will hold him hostage. If Megatrons group and the \nOblitercons want to fight, we will fight. But it will cost them the spiders \nlife!\n\n::: He stomps away :::\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n::: TRANSANULAS paced his lab that now served as his cell. He couldnt get out \nand all communications were cut off. There was nothing he could do. :::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS ::: Blast! I need those codes.\n\n::: He knew it was only a matter of time before HELL BEAST opened that door \nand killed him. Even if he did get out, Gremlin and Jackle were guarding him \naccording to the security cameras. Jackle was small, smaller than Rat Trap, \nhe wasnt really a threat. But Gremlin was the same size as Inferno, and just \nas powerful. Both were toted plasma assult riffles so he wouldnt get very \nfar...:::\n\n::: TRANSANULAS looks to the Proto-form. It was large, and what ever he \nanimal he picked it would be powerful. ...Should he use it? If it came down \nto the line, he would use it definetly. Sacrifice it if nessecery. He just \nhoped Megatron and the Oblitercons came. With them as a distraction he could \nescape. :::\n\n"}}
