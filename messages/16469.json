KitKats still a little wobbly from her\ninjuries but other than that she&#39;s ready for action.&quot; Phobia couldn&#39;t lie\nand say she&#39;s 100 percent, any bot that looked at her could tell that but\nthe effect wasn&#39;t permanent and she&#39;d be at 100 percent by the time the\nbattle began.\n\nKitKat and Drillbit made six brave warriors intene on destroying Megatron\nwith EXTREME prejudice.\n\nDestructor was new around here, he didn&#39;t know all the rules yet, Phobia was\nhappy to explain. &quot;Far as we know for sure the only one with Megatron is\nWaspinator but there is a chance that there are other factors involved which\nrequire strategic planning. KitKat saw Megatron associating with a bot named\nRowdy. This bot has associations with an alien race known as the Vok. We are\nprepared to assault and if possible destroy Megatron.&quot; Phobia paused to let\nthe information sink in. &quot;Then we will have the respect of the other\nPredacons.&quot;\n\nPhobia made eight. Eight on two sounded like good odds but there were always\nways to improve those odds and sideing with the alliance was just the way to\ndo it.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Alloran2@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@egroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 26, 2000 12:16 PM\nSubject: The Efrafans\n\n\n&gt; :::The Efrafans/Bludegon:::\n&gt;\n&gt; ::A ship crashed down on Earth near the Predacon base.
