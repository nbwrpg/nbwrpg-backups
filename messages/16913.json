She was in the mood to fight and she wanted to \nfight him.  She knew he was bigger and would be a challenge in \nbattel, but she felt that she had to try.  Per the chip, she wouldn&#39;t \nallow Slayer to dismiss her as a feeble female, but she had to prove \nto him that she was just as deserving of respect as Prebon.  She \nserved Prebon and wanted a little acknowlagement for it.  He was, to \nher, nothing anymore.  His body was that of Striker, but the Striker \nshe knew was gone forever.  This new bot, wasn&#39;t worth the time it \nwould take to put him into a trash compactor.  She wanted him slagged \nand she wanted to do the slagging.  He made her mad just by looking \nat her.  She turned to Prebon, then to Slayer to make sure he \nwouldn&#39;t hear her,&quot;Master Prebon, why keep him around? Sure when \nRamulus see&#39;s that Striker is gone, he will run. Why not program him \nto be Striker and add a chip to him. With the cip, he will follow \nyour every word. And he will be convincing enough for Ramulus.&quot; She \nloked down,&quot;Forgive me master, I have spoken out of place.&quot;\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, Yanshosh@a... wrote:\n&gt; ::Slayer::\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer laughs loudly and harshly as Spears pulls out a spear, \nobvioustly \n&gt; planning to attack him. The idea itself was humorous to him. A femm \nattacking \n&gt; him? He was sure the fight wouldn&#39;t last more than a nano-cycle. \nHis shoulder \n&gt; blasters emerge, his hands closing around both his swords. Slayer \nnarrows his \n&gt; eyes, ready for battle.\n&gt; \n&gt; He nearly growls in disapointment as he hears his masters orders, \nhis \n&gt; shoulder blasters sliding back in, and his hands leaving his \nswords. &quot;I \n&gt; apologize, Master,&quot; he says to Prebon, snarling at Spears \nafterwards.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Watch yourself, femm,&quot; he growls at her, pushing past her and \nwalking to the \n&gt; suit.\n&gt; \n&gt; He looks it over as he stops near it, not bothering to even glance \nback at \n&gt; Spears, his face breaking into an evil smile. It was excellent. \nRocket \n&gt; launchers, infared goggles, a pair of swords... (I&#39;m repeating what \nMinime \n&gt; posted about it, not making anything up)\n&gt; \n&gt; Slayer picks up the suit and begins to put it on.\n\n\n"}}
