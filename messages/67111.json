With a\nspin and flip Mymidon assumes his massive robot form\nas he drops to the ground several meters away from\nHydras. \n\nMyrmidon stands head and shoulders taller than your\naverage Predacon warrior and broader through the\nshoulder and hip. Predominantly black and purple his\ngait and stauture are agressive and yet controlled as\nhe moves towards Hydras&#39; position. \n\nHe has twin motar cannons, one over each shoulder, his\nleft arm ends in what appears to be jaws of a shark,\nwhich serves as a cannon mount as well. Large\nbird-like wings extend from his back, folding behind\nhim like some regal cloak. His head appears to a large\njungle cat&#39;s, jaws opened wide as if in perpetual\nroar. Inside the jaws Myrmidon&#39;s face can be made out,\nmuch of it shrowded in shadow, the cat&#39;s fangs\nprotrude down slightly over Myrmidon&#39;s forehead.  \n\nMyrmidon&#39;s powerful gaze sweeps the area before\nlocking on Hydras as he comes to stand in front of\nhim. Placing a clenched fist in front of his chest, he\nbows his head to Hydras. &quot;My liege.&quot; he intones in a\ndeep reverberous voice. \n\nPreston\n(Myrmidon)\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLuggage?
