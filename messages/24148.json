He modifies his dorsal gun to nail \ngun mode and \n&gt;   fires 9 nails at Breakdown, 8 at Dark One, and 8 at Astral.  he \nsees Klant \n&gt;   crawling back to him:: \n&gt;   Torca: You alright Klant? if not, get into a CR chamber, because \nyou look \n&gt;   pretty beaten up. \n&gt;   ::Sky Lynx flies to escape the fireballs, but one hits him \nanyway.  He only \n&gt;   gets hit by one ion disk.  he dodges the shots from Ares.  He \nfired 2 missles \n&gt;   from one gun at Pyro, 1 missle from the other at Manterror, and 1 \nmissle at \n&gt;   Ares.  Ratchet transformed to robot mode and escaped most of the \nshots, \n&gt;   thoguh some hit him in the arms.  Ratchet jumped out of the way \nof the connon \n&gt;   blast, and ended up being hit by some of Fenox&#39;s laser bolts.  He \nfired 15 \n&gt;   shots from each of his blasters at Scavenger and launched 1 \nexplosive tusk \n&gt;   blades at Sixshot, and one at Fenox.  Sideswipe escapes the sword \nblade.  He \n&gt;   got hit by 2 stinger missles and 5 optic blasts(between Injector \nand \n&gt;   Bumblebee). He fired 25 shots at Demon Wulf, 1 missle at \nInjector, and 1 \n&gt;   missle at Bumblebee.  Orion destroyed the missles with ones of \nhis own and \n&gt;   fired a missle, hoping to hit Double Punch.  He evaded the shots \nfr! om! Ares \n&gt;   and fired a missle at him.  He escapes the darts and fires 25 \nrapid fire \n&gt;   optic blasts at Starlight:: \n&gt;         eGroups Sponsor \n&gt; \n&gt;         Click Here!\n\n\n"}}
