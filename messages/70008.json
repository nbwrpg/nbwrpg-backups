At least that is the\ndiscription I have of it. There is suppose to be a secret door\nsomewhere, but from my understanding of it, you cannot spot it without\nhaving prior knowledge of it, and it can only be opened from the\ninside, or via remote control.\n\nBIC:\n\n&quot;Tuscon.&quot; Cyclonus&#39; calm voice transmited over a general communication\nchannel, &quot;I see you have undergone a change since we have met last.&quot;\nDignity and a cool humor laced Cyclonus&#39; voice, although there is an\nundertone of respect or perhaps curiousity as well. &quot;Hydras is the\ncommander of this facility. Have you come to serve the Predacon\nmilitary or perhaps give your life as we serve it?&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
