I=\r\n can&#39;t patch through either.  All I&#39;m getting is static.  Not good.&quot;\n\nTucso=\r\nn growls.\n\n&quot; It may not be as simple as interference.

Look what they did ta Nightlight, Windlo=\r\nrd, Rodimus, and Perceptor.  It wasn&#39;t fair, and it&#39;s still not fair.  And =\r\nbecause of Hydras, he&#39;s tarnished so many good reputations, it&#39;s enough ta =\r\nmake any bot go ill!&quot;\n\nNight Shift listens in on the conversation.\n\n&quot; Yeah,=\r\n well, as soon as this big guy&#39;s repaired and on duty, those creeps are gon=\r\nna wish that Optimus Prime finished them off before they got ta live this l=\r\nong.  I know Tucson, you do NOT wanna get on his bad side, not now not ever=\r\n.  I&#39;ve seen what he&#39;s capable of, turned some cons inta scrap vorns ago, t=\r\nill ya couldn&#39;t recognize who they were anymore. That was before he became =\r\na Prime, in rookie years.&quot;\n\nStraight Shot grins.\n\n&quot;I remember that.  Talon,=\r\n if you saw Tucson back then, you&#39;d be jumping for joy, because in the old =\r\ndays, he didn&#39;t think twice about turning a con inta scrap.  It was really =\r\nfun ta watch &#39;em pull them apart literally.  After that, only the really st=\r\nrong cons would try ta go up against him.&quot;\n\nTucson responds.\n\n&quot; Oh, those d=\r\nays may not be over yet, Straight Shot.  I will lay harm on those who have =\r\nlaid harm on all of you, I give you that promise. Rat Trap, part of my ener=\r\ngy is coming back, where are my guages now?&quot;\n\nRat Trap reads it.\n\n&quot;Yep, six=\r\nty percent, not wonderful but enough ta drive on.&quot;\n\nTucson now contacts Tor=\r\nca and Noctorro.\n\n&quot;Noctorro, Torca, I&#39;ve regained sixty percent of my energ=\r\ny reserve.  It should be enough for me to drive on my own now.  I thank you=\r\n deeply for your assistance, and wish not to burden you any further.  After=\r\n all, towing a vehicle my size and weight, must put quite a strain on your =\r\nsystems.

Please, don&#39;t strai=\r\nn yourselves on my account. I will take it slow, I promise. Night Shift, No=\r\nctorro, I need you two to go ahead of me, and get to the Ark as quickly as =\r\nyou can.  Torca, I will need you to bring up their flank. I will follow beh=\r\nind with Talon, Windlord, Rat Trap and Straight Shot.
