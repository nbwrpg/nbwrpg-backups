Ah ain&#39;t afraid of\n&gt; nothin&#39;!&quot; His face was cool and his eyes were relaxed as he looked at\n&gt; KitKat. After a moment, he leaned gently against her, not enough to put\nher\n&gt; off balance. He low chuckle still lingered.\n&gt;\n&gt; He looked out into the distance and saw a figure. A female figure. He\n&gt; thrusted himself to his feet and looked carefully. It was Stingtra, and\nfrom\n&gt; the looks of it, she was damaged.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Stingtra!&quot; he called out, with a tone of annoyance to his deep voice. He\n&gt; ran to her, bending down. &quot;What you do now?&quot; He pulled her up by her upper\n&gt; arm.\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Old school buds here:\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5536/13/_/_/_/962922356/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
