It is not \nfair to gang up on a single bot when he&#39;s not harming anyone.&quot;\n\n* Zyber then gently took the cup from the cratures hands and walked back \ntowards the fire, the tea no longer boiling thanks to the bowl.\nThe bowl was designed to only exert enough het through it to a temp that was \nhot enough to boil, the remainder of the time simply warding off the head \nand never getting any hotter.\nZyber dipped the cup into the amber tea, filling it and then walking back to \nthe bed.\nShe held the cup out to the damaged bot sitting up on her bed, waiting \ncalmly to take it from her hands.\nThough, there was still one thing that they hadn&#39;t said to each \nother...their names.*\n\n&quot; Um...if you would be so kind as to answer...what is your name?&quot;\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
