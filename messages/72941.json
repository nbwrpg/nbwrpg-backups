The room is\ndominated by a large cylinder in the middle of the room that is about\nfifteen feet in diameter and stretched from the floor all the way to a\nceiling that was perhaps 30 feet in the air. Energy was flowing\nthrough the cylinder, a black sort of energy with yellow motes of\nlight floating about within it.\n\nAround the room itself there are control panels and computer screens\nalong nearly the entire space of the wall. And it was light from the\ncylinders plus light from the panels the provided the only\nillumination in the chamber.\n\nHowever in the time it took for everyone to examine the room everyone\nbegan to feel a small stabbing pain in their processors. Whatever\nenergy that machine was giving ff, it was having an intensely\ndisruptive affect on all their systems.\n\nSHARPEDGE, who was holding his head with a pained expression on his\nface looked over at STAMPY and NIGHTLIGHT, &quot;I hope one of you two know\nhow to get into these panels and shut this thing down.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
