So, in plain, \nit almost seemed to cancle the other out.\nBut she knew just why Prowls thoughts had detinated their sparks, because he \nhad been jelouse of something that didn&#39;t matter.\n\nIron Raptor watched his blank look, then seeing his head lower in shame. \nProbably because her trust wavered, but maybe also because she found it hard \nto believe that he could have ever done something like...like...botch up the \nmost important thing in the world just because he was jelouse!\nIt was stupid, down right stupid!\n\nShe almost lost her balance as Prowl stepped back but kept it, wavering a \nbit but staying on her feel. Looking at Prowl in disbeliefe for a moment, \nthen hearing Prowls thoughts and then shaking her head slightly.\nNo, someone else could have done better, but she couldn&#39;t put what trust she \nhad felt in anybot else then Prowl.\nIn truth, she still trusted him, but it was so hard to think that he could \ndo what he had done.\nBut when she heard, or felt, Prowl feel the same jelousy when he thought \nabout Dinobot she found herself growling.\nIf she could have stepped towards Prowl she would have, but she was still \ngetting use to these legs.\nBut she saw the look he gave her the next moment, one that seemed as if he \nwas looking at ger for the last time. And for a moment she thought that he \nwas going to suddenly fly away, leaving her here on her own.\nBut, even through all that happened, she knew that he wouldn&#39;t.\n\nIron Raptor could feel his feelings though, anger at himself, sadness and \nother emotions, almost making her want to suddenly hold him and tell him \nthat everything was alright, but she had to get this all out into the open \nif it killed her...again.\nBut she just shook her head at Prowls thoughts, he wasn&#39;t a failure...he had \nonly failed at the task. The merge had failed...not him, not completely.\n\nShe sighed as Prowl turned his head away from her.*\n\n&quot; Am I that least of a person now that you can&#39;t even look at me when you \nspeak to me?&quot;\n\n* But...perhaps she had been a little to harsh on him before, but now her \nfeelings were so mixed up she didn&#39;t even know how to feel.\nBut there was no use in yelling at him.*\n\n&quot; Prowl...I can&#39;t exactly say that what you did was alright, but I can say \nthat it&#39;s forgivable. You may have killed us, but you also gave up yourself \nto make sure that we lived again.&quot;\n\n* Then, on unsteady legs she actually stepped towards him, placed a hamd om \nhis cheek and turned his head towards her so that she could look Prowl in \nthe eye.\nHer own face was blank of emotions, but her voice was a little hurt.*\n\n&quot; But how could you think something like that, how could you ever get \njelouse over someone I don&#39;t even know? I love you and you know I do, more \nthen anything in thie entire universe.\nYet you still thought that, and the price was our sparks.&quot;\n\n* She then leaned forward and kissed Prowl gently on the lips.*\n\n&quot; I don&#39;t hate you, and I still trust you and love you even more.\nI just can&#39;t understand why you would think such a thing.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
