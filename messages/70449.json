I had ins=\r\nulated your section until you returned, so that nothing would happen that y=\r\nou didn&#39;t want or expect. But that also means that your players are largely=\r\n in the dark :)\n\nThe easiest thing to do would be have your characters call=\r\n in for an update since I am sure they are as curious as you are. :)\n\nFrom =\r\ncommunication chatter your team would have heard and/or deduced that Tuscon=\r\n and some others went to recover Rodimus once and for all using some ruse t=\r\nhat he and Nightshift had cooked up. Tuscon and others were eventually capt=\r\nured but then somehow got free, and at first appeared successful at recover=\r\ning Rodimus but soon after communications were lost with Tuscon and his tea=\r\nm as he attempted to make his way back. \n\nHe has since returned bringing ba=\r\nck a heavily damaged Rodimus and a Predacon. \n\nSandy,\n\nYou are exactly righ=\r\nt, I was wondering why nobody responded to my post. I can see where it was =\r\nsent out, and all the tags on my side said that it was, but I see nothing o=\r\nn the list. I guess now I see :)\n\nI will resend. \n\nThanks,\nPreston\n\n\n\n"}}
