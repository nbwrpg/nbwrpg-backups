Within seconds of \nseeing\n&gt; the eyes strugle, the owner of the fist, Beastbox, brings it down \ninto the\n&gt; face of Condor, as hard as he can.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the corner Megatron had just entered the room with Beastbox, and \nScourge\n&gt; probably just behind him, he wasnt sure. Megatron sat down in one \nof the\n&gt; chairs in Switchblade&#39;s room, and crossed his legs, looking forward \nto the\n&gt; show. &quot;Switchblade, Scourge, Fireblade, you have the best seats in \nthe\n&gt; house. Before I left Cybertron, 4 millions years ago, Beastbox was \none of\n&gt; the Decepticons main interrogaters. Unfortunately he has a short \nfuse, and\n&gt; most robots he interrogates dont survive long enough to give us the\n&gt; information, he has kept his position due to pure entertainment he\n&gt; delivers&quot; Megatron finishes, with a smile crossing his face.\n\n\n"}}
