He gasped, and screamed. His mind was fulled with the memories of \nMegatron becoming the dragon, the incident that could have killed him. He \nremembered his trial.\n\n&quot;AUTO-GUNS, FIRE!&quot; he screamed.\n\nThe auto-guns turned and fired at the dragon.\n\nThis was no good. Why couldn&#39;t things go right? He was hungry, hurt, \nand---actually scared. He needed to continue fixing the comuter to the \nDarkside&#39;s programing. Hell Beast had messed with it&#39;s programing when he \nwas chased out.\n\nWith his spark still pulsing hard with his memories, he said to the \ncomputer, &quot;Computer, bring back programin&#39; bah unit Quickstrike. Bring back \ncommands an&#39; reformating of th&#39; Darkside.&quot; He thought to himself, you are \nthe Darkside now.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
