How did he know my name, she \nthought.  She did scan and noticed his weapons were down. If he was a \ndecepticon of sorts, he was either very smart, or very stupid. No one \never lowered weapons unless something is to be gained. But was was to \nbe gained by her coming forth? Was he after her energon?  She decided \nto walk out slowly towards him, but stayed near the trees incase she \nneeded cover in a hurry. She kept her pistol on him. &quot;WHo are you?&quot; \nDo I know you?&quot;\nHer logic circuits told her that she knew him, but she couldn&#39;t \nrecall from were. She wasn&#39;t sure if he was friend or foe.  She kept \nher distance, but wanted to understand what was going on. &quot;I am \nDarkMouse. Who are you?&quot;\n\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@y..., aerosmith60@c... wrote:\n&gt;  Galvatron stopped. He thought....ah what the hell. He blasted off \nand landed \n&gt; near where he could still sence her signature. he went into his \nrobot mode \n&gt; less intimidateing then a big silver dragon and put a smile on his \nface. \n&gt; &quot;Hello Darkmouse. Please come out where I can see you. MY weapons \nare down \n&gt; scan for yourself.&quot; They actualy were he knew that was the only way \nshe&#39;d \n&gt; come out.\n\n\n"}}
