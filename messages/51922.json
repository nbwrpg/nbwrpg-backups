That was an excellent post, but I&#39;m not sure how you got \nadded \n&gt; to the yahoogroup. I guess Rudrak or Azure must have added you \n&gt; though... otherwise I have no clue.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only thing that&#39;s wrong about this is the bio, Transformer \nstats \n&gt; generally go on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest \n(although, \n&gt; if you were to explain how your grading system worked, then it \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t matter). You should check out some of the bio&#39;s on the \n&gt; website for something to relate too.\n&gt; \n&gt; The thing you need to do right now, is to go to the NBWRPG \nwebsite, \n&gt; and check out the how to join section. http://www.nbwrpg.com/\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;raccoon7679&quot; &lt;raccoon7679@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Name: Smidgen\n&gt; &gt; Bot Type: Kit Fox\n&gt; &gt; Faction: Maximal\n&gt; &gt; Height: 4&#39;6&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Weight: 90lbs\n&gt; &gt; Strength: 17\n&gt; &gt; Speed:15\n&gt; &gt; Intelegence:16\n&gt; &gt; Wisdom:14\n&gt; &gt; Charisma:18\n&gt; &gt; Weapons: 1 Plasma Pistol, 1 Engeron Sword, 1 Energon Shield\n&gt; &gt; Natural Weapons: Teeth, Claws\n&gt; &gt; Special Training:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OOC:  Uh, if I mess this up, someone please let me know.  I&#39;m \n&gt; taking \n&gt; &gt; a leap of faith and hoping I&#39;m doing this right. Or at least in \na \n&gt; &gt; semi-acceptable form. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Smidgen:\n&gt; &gt; During a routine flight on a small cargo vessel, the \nStarSkipper, \n&gt; &gt; things appeared normal.  Smidgen was piloting the small craft \nfrom \n&gt; a \n&gt; &gt; moon 97 light years from her home world Tinkitry.  The ship was \n&gt; &gt; carring the latest shipment of energon that had been mined from \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; moon. It may not have seemed like a lot, but it would have \n&gt; supplied \n&gt; &gt; power to more than 80 cities for a year.  Energon mining was a \n&gt; very \n&gt; &gt; slow proccess.  It took the miners 8 months to mine this much. \n&gt; &gt; Smidgen sat back and rested her small feet on the console.  She \n&gt; &gt; yawned and put her hands behind her head. &quot;Yeah, this is the \n&gt; life.  \n&gt; &gt; No worries. No hurries.  Nothing to do but die of  bordom and \nwait \n&gt; &gt; untill my application for the HonorGuard to be accepted.&quot;  The \n&gt; &gt; HOnorGuard was an elite fighting group.  They protected the \n&gt; capital \n&gt; &gt; and those in power.  She had always dreamed of being a  guard \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; she was a little bot.  But for now she would have to wait \n&gt; &gt; patiently.  Although patients wasn&#39;t her strongsuit, she tried \nto \n&gt; &gt; remain calm. The long and boring flight was taking it&#39;s toll.  \n&gt; Cargo \n&gt; &gt; ships weren&#39;t known for thier speed.   She was about to put the \n&gt; ship \n&gt; &gt; on AUTO PILOT when the ship shook violantly.  She regained \ncontrol \n&gt; &gt; of the helm and checked her instruments.  A hole in spacec \n&gt; appeared \n&gt; &gt; off her port bow.  &quot;I thought black holes were supposed to be so \n&gt; &gt; black that you couldn&#39;t even see them?&quot;  She felt the ship being \n&gt; &gt; pulled towards the hole.  She was being forced up against the \n&gt; inside \n&gt; &gt; of her chair by the g-forces as the ship was being sucked \n&gt; &gt; in.  &quot;DAMN! Got....to...get this...puppy out...of here.&quot;  SHe \n&gt; bould \n&gt; &gt; feel herself starting to black out. She reached up and hit the \n&gt; auto \n&gt; &gt; pilot button, but the force of the hole was too great. The ship \n&gt; sped \n&gt; &gt; up and slipped into the hole.  For Smidgen, there was \ndarkness.   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She awoke still in the chair of the ship.  She rubbed her optics \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; looked around.  Sitting forward, she tried to regain power and \n&gt; &gt; control over the ships systems.  Nothing worked. &quot;Oh just \nswell.  \n&gt; &gt; How am I going to make my delivery on time now Huh?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She looked out the front windows and noticed that there were \n&gt; &gt; branches sticking through the shield.  She got up out of the \nchair \n&gt; &gt; and walked to the back to check on the cargo.  The ship rocked \n&gt; back \n&gt; &gt; and forth as she walked the length of the small ship.   &quot;Uh, \nthat \n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot; She walked back to the front and looked out \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; window.  It dawned on her that the ship was stuck in a giant \ntree. \n&gt; &gt; She estimated she was about 100 feet up or so.  She swallowed \nhard \n&gt; &gt; and very slowly sat down in her chair. &quot; Oh boy. Now what?&quot;  She \n&gt; &gt; carefully reached over to a small red panel in the middle of the \n&gt; &gt; console.  Pressing a red button, she activated the \ndistress/homing \n&gt; &gt; beacon on the ship.  With luck, her friends would find her soon \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; she&#39;d be able to get the shipment to it&#39;s destination. &quot;Heh, \n&gt; better \n&gt; &gt; late than never I guess. At least I&#39;m in one piece. But where \nthe \n&gt; &gt; heck am I?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
