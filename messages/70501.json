We need to plan the\n&gt;&gt; next move&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Cyclonus nodded and with a slight wince rose to his feet. &quot;We shall\n&gt; have everyone up as soon as we can.&quot; He said to Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Including you too Cyclonus.&quot; Fractyl said, &quot;You are in need of\n&gt; repairs. Go slowly.&quot; He glanced over at Hydras, &quot;I will send you a\n&gt; report as soon as I know more.&quot; he said, his voice already destracted\n&gt; as he looked over the injured, trying to decide who needed his help\n&gt; first.\n&gt;\n&gt; *     *     *     *     *\n&gt;\n&gt; A few minutes later in Hydras&#39; throne room many of Predacon soldiers\n&gt; were already begining to arrive as per his orders.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two of Hydras&#39; long time soldier were among the first, Terrorsaur,\n&gt; Waspinator, they looked somewhat out of sorts. They had been away for\n&gt; quite some time and it was obvious that they had only recently\n&gt; returned from other duties and other commanders, and they were still\n&gt; unsure of this new form of Megatron called Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then came the fuzors, the Predacons who&#39;s beast modes were\n&gt; combinations of two different beasts at one: Skyshadow, thier leader\n&gt; and then Injector, Buzzclaw, Terrorgator, and Quickstrike, Quickstrike\n&gt; being the most familiar to Hydras.\n&gt;\n&gt; The last to arrive was Taratulus. He came striding in looking every\n&gt; bit put off by this seeming intrusion on his time. He seemed surprised\n&gt; at the number of soldier that appeared here and said nothing. Instead\n&gt; he sat back as if biding his time, suddenly interested in all the new\n&gt; things going on, and the new opportunities presenting themselves.\n&gt;\n&gt; With all these soldier showing up, there were still others who may\n&gt; have been out on patrols or are unavailable. However there are two who\n&gt; did not appear nor check in: Jhiaxus and Scorponok.\n&gt;\n&gt; As Hydras entered the room followed by Deepstryke, Blackrazor and\n&gt; Phobia as well as Igunanus and then by Inferno, the room came to\n&gt; attention. &quot;We are yours to command mighty Hydras!&quot; Sky Shadow said as\n&gt; he came to the front and saluted. &quot;What are your orders?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;\n&gt; Preston\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
