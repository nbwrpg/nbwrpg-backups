It stands about 20 feet tall, which is\nalmost three times as tall as the Predacon himself is. A few baskets\nof fruit still lay at its feet.\n\nAll of this is sitting in a rather large clearing surrounded by trees\nand bushes. The question is what will the MAXIMALS do? Will they\nexamine the statue? Follow the PROTOHUMANS? Go back to the ARK? Or do\nthey have something else in mind?\n\n(TAG)\n\n- Preston\n\n"}}
