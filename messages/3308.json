He passed the confindment area where he heard \nRattrap was locked up. He didn&#39;t bother to go by the door, he just went on, \nexploring the rooms of the ship. He had tried locked doors and poked his \nhead in half opened ones to see what was in them. He had seen a room full of \nweapons and heavy guns. It must have been the artilery room. He knew where \nthe control room was, and didn&#39;t dare to go there again. Two--three fights \ntoday was enough.\n\nAs he began to pass a room that looked like it was the bridge. He had been \nhere once. He saw a gather of bots there, one was Megatron. He quickly swung \nout of sight before any of them saw him. The majority of them were against \nhim. He stood beside the frame of the door and listened to them. Perhaps now \nwas a good time he could talk to Megatron about his plan.\n\nHe kicked the corridor wall with his metal heel a few times to get his \nattention. Then he tried his best to disguise his deep voice, not wanting to \ncatch the others. He called his name.\n\n\n&gt;From: JP3884@...\n&gt;Reply-To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;To: nbwrpg@egroups.com\n&gt;Subject: Re: Neo Beast Wars\n&gt;Date: Wed, 14 Jun 2000 13:46:55 EDT\n&gt;\n&gt;::: Hell Beast ::: Ah, Rampage, you can take Inferno and Tankkor and repair\n&gt;some of the Auto-guns.
