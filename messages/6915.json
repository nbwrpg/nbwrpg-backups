(Ramhorn can spot him if he&#39;s looking at scanners.)  \nHe&#39;d almost gotten in a fight with Ripper. The Maximals were \nshorthanded here or he&#39;d go elsewhere. There isn&#39;t much use for an \nimperfect Bot. his scanners were useless, no visual tracking, no long \nrange scans, even his mapping systems seemed different.\n\nLooking back to the Ark, he thought &quot;I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot; Somewhere \ninside him he knew they&#39;d need the help of every Maximal.\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, logomorph@h... wrote:\n&gt; ::Shadow Wing::\n&gt; \n&gt; She reached the pod nad looked at it.

She wanted to talk \n&gt; to lunarpine about what he had said and try to mjend things.  She \n&gt; hoped that he would not be too harsh on her for taking the hit for \n&gt; him.  She smiled.  She thought back to went they were playing in \nthe \n&gt; forest and she caught thaqt crow for him.  She swooped down and \n&gt; stopped at a branch hugh in the tree.  She waited a bit.  She \nfinally \n&gt; saw a nice fat crow flying by.  She swooped down and caught it in \nher \n&gt; talons.  She carried it back to the base.  It would be a nice treat \n&gt; for her friend.  At least she hoped that they were still friends.\n\n\n"}}
