It would fit five, \nand had medical capabilities, but no CR chamber. The front of the ship had \ndouble cannons that would be used in defence, and on the two wings of the \nvessle rested a missle turret. It was a fair craft, and Megatron was going to \nuse it on his ambassadorial missions.\n    &quot;Adrax, Waspinator! Lets load up. Were going to go and see my old friend \nInferno and Rampage.&quot; He commanded in a bastardly voice.\n    Adrax spun around, in confusion. &quot;Why there?&quot; His multi-green eyes \nnarrowed.\n    Megatron&#39;s face fell in pure disgust, &quot;Because....they are the key to the \ncomplete allience of the Predacons and our victory over this planet and our \nenemys!&quot;\n    Waspinator giggled and buzzed inside the ship.\n\n    Aracnia looked to Darkmouse and Quickstrike, &quot;Get into the transport with \nme. Were heading back to the ship.&quot;\n\n"}}
