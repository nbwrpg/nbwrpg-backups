Qucikly scanning the area and calculating chances against\neverybot as with a single glance he spotted the bot Prowl distracted\nin the air.\n&quot;Scrraaaawww....&quot; the vulture screamed as he flew at Prowls back his\nlarge claws ready to rip threw him and his mouth open to pry him\napart. He also liked the pretty globes that Prowl had thinking to take\nthem for himself.\n\n\n"}}
