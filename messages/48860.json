Although\n&gt; I\n&gt;   wish Tankor would post for Cheetah, or whoever has\n&gt; him\n&gt;   for Megatron.\n&gt; \n&gt;   --- Hollywood Narrator &lt;thecode@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;   &gt; And so, realizing that he has failed to make a\n&gt;   &gt; successful comeback in NBW, the Hollywood\n&gt; Narrator\n&gt;   &gt; decides that retirement might be the best\n&gt; solution.\n&gt;   &gt; He has no regrets, other than that he just\n&gt; couldn&#39;t\n&gt;   &gt; hold onto his spot in the NBW like he wanted to.\n&gt; His\n&gt;   &gt; posts, this one included, have lost all of their\n&gt;   &gt; life and energy. He degenerates rapidly, and\n&gt;   &gt; although he is not a bad RPer, like he once was,\n&gt; he\n&gt;   &gt; feels that he is not up to par with alot of\n&gt; other\n&gt;   &gt; people. He is clueless, he does not know what is\n&gt;   &gt; going on with the RPG and does not know what to\n&gt; do\n&gt;   &gt; with his characters. He feels he had a pretty\n&gt; good\n&gt;   &gt; run, and at one point was almost on top. He had\n&gt;   &gt; nearly the greatest number of all time\n&gt; characters in\n&gt;   &gt; the RPG&#39;s history, and his characters actually,\n&gt;   &gt; although through gan grape (Get it?), destroyed\n&gt; one\n&gt;   &gt; of the Predacon bases. He has not always been\n&gt; easy\n&gt;   &gt; to work with. He&#39;s complained, he&#39;s challenged\n&gt;   &gt; things, he&#39;s argued with the highest of people,\n&gt;   &gt; because he worked hard to protect what he had\n&gt;   &gt; already established. But now, nobody misses the\n&gt;   &gt; Hollywood Narrator&#39;s posts. Nobody is interested\n&gt; in\n&gt;   &gt; trying to do storylines with the aging veteran.\n&gt;   &gt; Before the character limit, he was promising.\n&gt; After\n&gt;   &gt; the limit happened, he just seemed to float off\n&gt; into\n&gt;   &gt; space, not able to have fun with his limited\n&gt; cast.\n&gt;   &gt; Should the Hollywood Narrator leave? Maybe that\n&gt;   &gt; should be for the RPG to decide. I am in a sad\n&gt; state\n&gt;   &gt; with NBW right now...\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   &gt; New, New, New World Order! 4 life! 4 life!\n&gt;   &gt; \n&gt;   &gt; Watcha gonna do when HulkaMania runs wild on\n&gt; you!?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   __________________________________________________\n&gt;   Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt;   Yahoo!
