She \nlooked at Quickstrike for a moment and went back to looking at her notes.  \nShe closed her note book and walked closer to Quickstrike.\n&quot;If you would please commander help me with the lazar.&quot;\n\nShe walked out of the tunnel and to a large lazar driller that was in a far \ncorner of the cave.  She drove it back to the end of the tunnel and stepped \ndown from it.\n&quot;Your a bigger than I am and handling the controls may be easier for you.  \nI&#39;d like to watch the drilling up closer so I can make sure it is done \naccording to my figures.  If it is not done just right, you could have the \nnewly drilled tunnel collapse.  I just want to prevent that from happening. \nIf that&#39;s OK with you commander?&quot;\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
