Anyway, Thanks for being honest with me about Tucson. So I \n&gt; heard right...  Someone mentioned Tucson Prime in the transmissions.. \n&gt; Good for him, He worked really hard ta get ta where he is, and ta become a \n&gt; Prime..  The Matrix made a great choice.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She now picks up on Tucson Prime&#39;s location.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; According to my sensors, he&#39;s in the Black Fortress, beneath the \n&gt; foundation in some sort of deep tunnel system.  Well, I just can&#39;t sit \n&gt; around and wait for him can I?  After all, he&#39;s gonna need me.  When we \n&gt; work together, we hardly miss our targets.   It&#39;s real rare that we do but \n&gt; most of the time, any arrow that gets shot by us, usually hits its mark. \n&gt; Sorry, can&#39;t stick around Lord Elder, I gotta get off my aft and do \n&gt; something.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She darts toward the exit door, and then forgets the most important \n&gt; aspect. Her inability to fly, and the fact that her alt form is a weapon \n&gt; not a vehicle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Oh, yeah, I forgot.  I - can&#39;t fly and I don&#39;t transform into a vehicle. \n&gt; Think I can borrow one of your shuttles sir?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, Preston Carroll &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Who: LORD ELDER, Elita, Straight Shot\n&gt;&gt; Location: Ark - Command Center\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Elita, it&#39;s been a long time, I missed you.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; She then looks to Lord Elder. She had met him at one time, but did not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get the chance to really know him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Lord Elder, Right? It&#39;s been a long time, and I think we were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; introduced a while ago, but, maybe ya don&#39;t remember who I am. If not,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m Straight Shot, Tucson&#39;s half sister and his all time favorite \n&gt;&gt; &gt; weapon of choice.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But we&#39;re not cheating, he does all the aiming and firing when he uses \n&gt;&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh, yeah, ya might not know that part. My alt modes are Cross Bow and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; regular bow. So, um, speakn&#39; of my half brother.. He is okay right?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Elder turned around to take in Straight Shot, his optics widened\n&gt;&gt; slightly, &quot;Um, y . . yes&quot; Elder stammered slightly trying to get his\n&gt;&gt; words out, clearly at a loss. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He said as he stood to face\n&gt;&gt; her. &quot;I had quite forgotten you were back there. I think I&#39;m going to\n&gt;&gt; have to make an inventory of who&#39;s back there.&quot; He said as he\n&gt;&gt; chuckled.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He glanced back at the board which was intermittently giving radio\n&gt;&gt; responses from the various Autobots and Maximal&#39;s as the ark\n&gt;&gt; communication was able to receive it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From what I can gather Tuscon is on his way out with Rodimus Prime,\n&gt;&gt; Windlord and Nightlight as well.&quot; He paused and mumbled, &quot;I can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; gaurantee what shape they&#39;ll be in though.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A radio transmission came through from Lord Persues at the old Maximal\n&gt;&gt; Base . . .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Tuscon, I&#39;m reading your location, please let us know if you need \n&gt;&gt; &gt; asistance,&quot; Perseus replied.  &quot;Lord Elder, do you read?&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder turned as he got the transmission, &quot;Yes, I am reading you loud\n&gt;&gt; and clear.&quot; Elder slid back into his seat as he attenuated the\n&gt;&gt; transmission, &quot;We are standing by to receive any wounded from the\n&gt;&gt; rescue mission, and we have Straight Shot here for any back up.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Elder glanced back at her grinning somewhat sheepishly, hoping that\n&gt;&gt; his assumption was right.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (TAG)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Preston\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Yahoo!
