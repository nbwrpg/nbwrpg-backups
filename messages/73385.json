This further loosens up dull scale like film which comes off =\r\nlike silver translucent material, similar to what a snake sheds.  Beneath i=\r\nt, brilliant shimmering scales emerge.  It was like he was slowly evolving =\r\nbeneath an old skin.  And as serpents do, his tail seems to grow a tiny bit=\r\n longer with the shedding of his old skin.  Yet this was only happening in =\r\nhis beast mode.  \n\n&quot; Hmm..  Talon, could you scratch behind my neck for me?=\r\n  It&#39;s the one place I can&#39;t reach.  I&#39;ve never encountered shedding, and t=\r\nhis must be what happened to the old dragon from time to time.&quot;\n\nUproar loo=\r\nks to the shed material curiously and paws at it.  He finds it hard like me=\r\ntal.\n\n&quot; Woah, it got really hard.  Like armor almost.  Neat.  This must hap=\r\npen ta reptiles all the time.  I&#39;ve even heard of spiders shedding skins if=\r\n you can believe that.  Ughhh..  I bet Tarantulus does that too, when he&#39;s =\r\nin spider mode. Hey speak&#39;n of natural processes, dragons are thought ta br=\r\neathe fire, but you don&#39;t seem ta do that huh?&quot;\n\nTucson shakes his head.\n\n&quot;=\r\n No, but I do recall being able to produce some electrical particles using =\r\nthe same principle .  And when I roar, it mimics the sound of thunder.  I s=\r\nuspect the old dragon was some sort of elemental master.  He breathes light=\r\nning and roars out thunder through his vocal chords.  I&#39;m beginning to thin=\r\nk he may have past that down to me.&quot;\n\nUproar chuckles.\n\n&quot; That means when y=\r\nou and Talon have a family, your offspring is gonna inherit that ability.  =\r\nYa never know, your first kid might end up being a dragon, or ya might get =\r\nlucky and have one of each.  But if it does take after dear old dad, better=\r\n make sure it&#39;s not a fire breather.&quot;\n\nTucson chuckles and rubs his paw on =\r\nUproars head, messing up his fur in a playful manner.\n\n&quot; We&#39;ll see, don&#39;t c=\r\nount the dragons before they hatch.&quot;\n\nUproar continues to laugh.\n\n&quot; No, ser=\r\niously, dragons are known ta have more than just one offspring.  They&#39;re li=\r\nke gators and crocs, they tend to have a clutch of eggs that hatch into hat=\r\nchlings.   Reptiles and birds normally produce eggs that hatch when they&#39;ve=\r\n fully developed.  The only exception is, that some snake species actually =\r\nbare live young.  Now that could happen too, but for the most part, dragons=\r\n lay eggs and so do birds.  Soooo, you guys might just produce a small clut=\r\nch of eggs that need ta be incubated over a course of time.  I dunno, its j=\r\nust some intel I read on birds and reptiles.&quot;\n\nTucson nods.\n\n&quot; It&#39;s alright=\r\n, I&#39;ve read that too at one point.  You&#39;re correct, it could happen that wa=\r\ny.  Which makes me curious as to other organic properties I seem to be expe=\r\nriencing..  Like hunger...  I admit, I snapped up a fish from a near by wat=\r\ner source and I consumed it in beast mode.  And the other mammals for some =\r\nodd reason sparked my appetite.  But I didn&#39;t have the spark to hunt them. =\r\n I merely got a meal from the water instead. &quot;\n\nUproar nods.\n\n&quot; Confession,=\r\n I took down a wild pig and I ate it... In beast mode of course.  And it ta=\r\nsted really good too.

However to what degree&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; is difficult to quantify.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There was a nod from=\r\n BUMP, &quot;So it may cure them . . . &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;. . . or it may do =\r\nnothing at all.&quot; SANTON said as he realized the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; import of their wo=\r\nrds.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There was a hissing sound as injection guns rose fr=\r\nom the beds of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; TUSCON and UPROAR.
