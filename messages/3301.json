Snow Tech was getting\n&gt; anoyed and frustrated. He decided to listen in on them\n&gt; via his com-link. After opening his com-link he and\n&gt; Shadow Cat heard Dark Mouses Request for help, but\n&gt; didn&#39;t hear a reply. Shadow Cat looked at Snow Tech.*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; We should help if no one else will, I mean, we\n&gt; can&#39;t just let an injured bot lie there!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * Snow Tech nodded,*\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot; Yeah, the service around here is crappy, so we\n&gt; might as well do something to pass the time while\n&gt; Inny, Er, has her fun.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  * And so, with that agreement, they headed for the\n&gt; signal, which was dangerously close to the Predacon\n&gt; base.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
