His attempt at \nbeing a\n&gt; hero blew up in his face and it cost KitKat some serious damage\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia turned and saw the injured Starscream. &quot;I&#39;m alright but we \nmust get\n&gt; to a secure area.&quot; He watched as Starscream collapsed again. Maybe \nsomething\n&gt; good could come of this situation after all.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Theres only one fair way to do this and since the Predacons rairly \nsettle\n&gt; for diplomacy I say we have KitKat name her successor.&quot;\n&gt; There was a time for diplomacy in the Predacon ranks and that was\nto \nsize up\n&gt; your opponent until they turned thier back.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phobia knew the rules all to well. Starscream could be more heavily \ndamaged\n&gt; than they realized that would make him to much a liability, Dollen\n&gt; Goldeneye, and Drillbit were to close to this emotionally to allow \nthe\n&gt; decisions that could lead to sacrificeing one of the teamates, Atma \nseemed\n&gt; to have some personal grudge against Drillbit making him \nunacceptable as the\n&gt; leader.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But if I must vote I think Terrosaur will suffice until either \nKitKat is\n&gt; back on her feat or until we find someone more appropriate.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
