He \nwas a big big gestalt though so it didn&#39;t do any real damage. Element fires \ntwo missiles at Tantrum and mentally guided them to their target while \nrunning at Tantrum and trying to squash him with his large foot.\n\n\nCyndro continued to fire at Hell Beast and his troups. He wasn&#39;t going to go \neasy on them (JP, Cyndro is firing EMP blasts and missiles and everything, \nso post for them too. they&#39;d probably hit because Hell Beast is so close and \nCyndro is a deadly aim). The disk on top of the Element (ship) fired another \nshockwave at Hell Beast. This one was even stronger than the last, and was \nalmost bound to knock some bots down.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Maximal ship flew down toward earth, but escape pods were already \nlaunching off. Five in all, the pods had a Maximal symbol on it, as well as \na bunch of emergency equipment (the scanner thingies :). The ship crashed \nand exploded several dozen miles away from the Cybertronian Fire, and the \npods landed in a mile radius around it. The pods began to scan for nice \nlifeforms to use on this planet.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
