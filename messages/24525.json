He gathered his thought, and sent a batch of eight cluster \nmissles at EndBringer.\n\n    Tankkor growled as he was pelted with blasts. He turned and sent his mian \nlaser turret blast at Killfest.\n\n    Nighteyes covered her head, and with a bleeding hand, began to unload on \nGreven.\n\n    Aerostreak dove into Killfest, sending them both skidding across the \nforest floor. (Hope you dont take that as a mode, sorry if you do.)\n\n    Akron pickes her target. She see&#39;s Darkmouse and Scather, (Well, dosent \nactually see Scather) and sends several Energon bolt blasts at them.\n\n    Putnam spots Golden eyes, and takes off into the air. He extends his \nhands and manages to grab hold of her leg, and begins to drain some energy \nout of her.\n\n    Odiphious takes his riffle out and fires at Drillbit, and then sends an \nenergon bolt at him.\n\n    Venus, armed with an energon pistol, fires at Dollen. She is stil lsore \nfrom a hit she took in the shoulder.\n\n    Megatron turns to Megaton. &quot;Come on, Megaton, Marine, Pheniox, Jackle, \nand Gremlin. Youre all coming with me to help out in the forest. Lets go.&quot;\n    Megatron was finally going to strech his legs after beening cooped up in \nthe ice cave for so long. \n\n    \n\n"}}
