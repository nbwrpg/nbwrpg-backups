I think you need to set a ruling in\n&gt;stone on this because it&#39;s clear that discussion is\n&gt;pointless with the nothing coming of it. I think a\n&gt;rule needs to be set that if a player is not given a\n&gt;fair chance to reply, then any posts beyond the point\n&gt;of a realistic reply (as in anything that would\nexceed\n&gt;time periods where characters reply if the situation\n&gt;were real) be declared VOID. Because I currently\ndon&#39;t\n&gt;see how I can continue in this RPG when I&#39;m not given\n&gt;a fair chance to reply.\n&gt;\n&gt;http://greetings.yahoo.com.au - Yahoo!
