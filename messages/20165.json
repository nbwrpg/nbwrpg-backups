She opened her eyes and saw she was being caried \nby a bot. She recognized his face but coudn&#39;t remember his name. She \nleaned her head back and closed her eyes again.  She felt dizzy and \nwasn&#39;t sure what was wrong. She had a pain in her shoulder where the \nneedle had stuck her. She groanes softly and looked up at Havoc. Her \nvision was a little blurry. She leaned her head against his shoulder \nand tried to run a self diognostic.  She felt the system run.  It \nshowed that she had a chemical in her body. And it was the chemical \nthat made her feel so out of it. She whispered, &quot;What happened?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
