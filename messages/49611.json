On impact it \n&gt; generates a localized magnetic field, shorting out electronics.  \n&gt; Repeated hits can send a bot into stasis lock quickly no matter how \n&gt; well armored.  It also tends to wipe out short-term memory.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@y..., &quot;airly2000&quot; &lt;airly2002@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Nightlight::\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nightlight fell stunned; Destructor&#39;s bite had reached her \nshoulder \n&gt; &gt; and did a severe wound there.
