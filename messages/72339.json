Yet she\n&gt; appears in deep concentration as if coming upon an important piece of a\n&gt; puzzle.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Nope, nothing yet Talon but, there are a few aspects that kind of help ta\n&gt; narrow things down a little bit.  First, from what we have all sensed, the\n&gt; energy IFF readings appear ta be Unicronian in nature.  So whoever it is,\n&gt; definitely must be a MINION of considerable power and they must be some sort\n&gt; of authority figure.  Like a military general who is a major tactician.  And\n&gt; that means they must be strong as well as smart.  I wonder if we would come\n&gt; up with something by using those keywords ta do a digital intel search and\n&gt; see what that comes up with..&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Rattrap nods.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; It&#39;s worth a try. But Legacy is the only bot with that kinda access ta\n&gt; that intel.  But I bet he&#39;d help ya do a search if the three of us asked.\n&gt; It can&#39;t hurt ta know who and what we&#39;re up against.&quot;\n\n&lt;NEW&gt;\n\nAs SANTON rushed up onto the shuttle, follwed quickly enough by\nWINGCALIBER the others stayed on the pad in case they could be of\nother service.\n\nTORCA looked at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;You could be right.&quot; He said as he\nstepped foward into the conversation, his Fuzors stepping up as well.\nThey were ready for action, well all except for SILVERBOLT who was\nstill recovering in the medbay.\n\n&quot;I have read the reports.&quot; NOCTORRO said. &quot;I believe Legacy will be\nhere shortly as well. I am sure LEO PRIME will have a few last minute\norders for him as he get&#39;s this mission underway.&quot;\n\nLORD ELDER entered as well. &quot;Leo Prime is in conversation with Hydras,\ntrying to close the deal that Tuscon opened. If he can do that, we\nmight get some extra help.&quot;\n\nHe looked over at STRAIGHT SHOT, &quot;So you think these new enemies are\nworking with the Unicronians?&quot; He nodded as if giving the matter some\nserious thought. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; He looked at the others. &quot;Noctorro is\nright Legacy will be here to answer as many questions as he can\nanswer. He is the closest thing we have to a science expert. I wish we\nhad Perceptor here.&quot; He paused and added, &quot;I mean the old Perceptor.&quot;\n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n"}}
