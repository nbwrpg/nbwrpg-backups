She flexed her hands and\n&gt;   arms and felt the knew skin that covered them.  She very slowly sat up\n&gt;   and looked at herself.  She loked around until her optics rested on\n&gt;   Perceptor. &quot;You are a genius.&quot;  She turned and slowly lowered herself\n&gt;   off the table. &quot;Hmmm, now I really do feel comfortable in my skin.&quot; \n&gt;   She glanced down and noticed a few other changes. &quot;Hmm, new blaster\n&gt;   ports I see. You have really outdone yourself. I shall sing your\n&gt;   praise to your superior. Infact, I would recommend he under go an up\n&gt;   grade like this himself. You truely have done well.&quot; \n&gt;   She was in fact very impressed with his skill. She knew that to have\n&gt;   this bot on her side later would be her greatest advantage.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
