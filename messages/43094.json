It opens as a bot steps out. He is a camo painted helicoptor,\nwearing the Autobot logo. He had just come back online after being\ndeactivated by Decepticons, not to long ago. He had learned that\nhundreds of years had passed. He found out about the Neo Beast Wars, and\nhad reconfigured himself to fit the modern day transformer.(The G1 to BW\nsize problem, activation code, etc.) He set his communication system to\nrecord.\n&quot;To any Maximal or possibly Autobot forces in the neo Beast Wars, this\nis the Autobot Skyburst. If you read me please make contact. I wish to\njoin a Maximal or Autobot faction.&quot;\nHe set the message to play looped on incoded Maximal and Autobot\nchannels. He waited.\n\nOOC: I would prefer him to join an Autobot group. Anyway he looks like\nthe Sandstorm Machine Wars toy.\n\n"}}
