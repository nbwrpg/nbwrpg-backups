Until then his only existence was as cells from the\ntransmetal T-Rex Megatron and a large Maximal dragon named Necromancer.\nSince Veratis&#39; past hasn&#39;t really been revealed as to where he got the\nprotoforms he&#39;s been &quot;Improving&quot; (Experimenting on with a mutant virus which\nremoves most signs of a robot form) I&#39;m sure something can be worked out,\nmaybe have Stallex attacked by a bot resembling Megaton. A resemblance of\nhis former mode might exist through the DNA replication. This could open a\nrivalry between him and a few bots in the game. (Necromancer, Veratis,\nMegaton, just to name three.)\nSound OK to you? either that or we&#39;ll just say a future temporal anomaly\nwill send Megaton back in time to when Stallex was young but it hasn&#39;t\nhappened to him yet. (If theres anyone who understands temporal physics\nplease explain them to me, I&#39;m getting a headache just thinking about it.)\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;dewboy30816@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 16, 2001 11:32 AM\nSubject: angry\n\n\n&gt; Stallex had improved,but his dad was furious and figting harder than\n&gt; ever so Stallex was being crushed.
