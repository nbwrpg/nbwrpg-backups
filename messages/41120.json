He landed in a bush with a thud. Grimlock transformed, and\n\n\n&gt; stood up, getting ready to fire a rocket from his gun. He leveled it,\n\n\n&gt; but got slammed in the chest by the distabyliser ray, which sent funny\n\n\n&gt; signals into his brain, causing him to step awckwardly a few times. He\n\n\n&gt; stepped once to many, and began to fall backwards, then hit the ground\n\n\n&gt; hard, as the impact caused his rockets to go off, to his right, into the\n\n\n&gt; pack of Autobots.\n\n\n&gt; \n\n\n&gt; Cliffjumper eyes widdened when he saw one of the rockets heading towards\n\n\n&gt; him and Pacifix, and jumped at Torca, trying to tackle him out of the\n\n\n&gt; way.\n\n\n"}}
