As they are still following a =\r\ntrail they are still able to pass through it relatively easily, but at the =\r\nsides of the trail the brush and plants are becoming thicker and greener. H=\r\nowever as we have night still falling, the way ahead is getting darker, and=\r\n the gnarled tree limbs beginning to look as much like claws as they do woo=\r\nd. \n\nFor those who have chosen to fly. Before them would be what appears to=\r\n be an a dark ocean of or dark green water complete with waves as the tops =\r\nof tress move lazily in response to unseen breezes. The sky itself is clear=\r\n and bright, very little in the way of cloud cover and the moon is just beg=\r\ninning to make itself seen as it rises up over the horizon of trees. A casu=\r\nal gaze downward shows the rest of the group walking along, wether in robot=\r\n mode or beast mode, but a quick glance ahead showed that in very short ord=\r\ner the group below will be harder and harder to locate due to the every inc=\r\nreasing density of the plant life. \n\nFor those who were burrowing along und=\r\nerground, even their way was becoming slowed with the massive entanglement =\r\nof roots that sat just beneath the surface of the ground. \n\nHowever for all=\r\n teams there is one constant. Within the space of a mile the communications=\r\n go from crystal clear to non-existent. Even the IFF com-signal goes down, =\r\nand everyone is restricted to sensory recognition only. Even sensors are mu=\r\nffled somewhat, although visual, audio and olfactory senses appear to be un=\r\naffected. \n\nAt the front of the group on the ground LEO PRIME walked in bea=\r\nst mode, a lion stalking through the jungle, looking completely at home her=\r\ne. TORCA, who was in an almost nightmarerish fusion of elephant and killer =\r\nwhale walked next to him, and on the other side was SANTON in his MAMMOTH b=\r\neast mode. \n\nAround these three ranges the rest of the Maxmals, some in the=\r\n air, like AIRHAMMER, NOCTORRO and WINGCALIBER while there were others on t=\r\nhe ground like BANTOR. \n\nThen again the PREDACONS were here too, making the=\r\nir presence felt as they flew and walked. SKYSHADOW was in the air in beast=\r\n mode along with BUZZCLAW and INJECTOR, while QUICKSTRIKE and TERRORGATOR w=\r\nalked on the ground. \n\n&quot;This way!&quot; LEO PRIME said as he walked on. &quot;The sig=\r\nnal is coming from this way.&quot; He was carrying the makeshift tracking device=\r\n, its signal taking him darker and darker into the dark of the Jungle!\n\nOOC=\r\n: I am not sure who is flying and who is walking. Most I can make assumptio=\r\nns on. Is Hydras flying or walking, I am not sure if the Hydra has wings? A=\r\nlso is Buzzsaw going to be flying above the trees or just below the treelin=\r\ne. Either one is possible, although it will call for some fancy flying to s=\r\ntay below as the trees get denser. \n\n(TAG)\n\nPreston\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
