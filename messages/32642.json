His eyes surveyed the \nsight, and then fell upon Hell Beast. Element ran forward and launched \nseveral missiles at Hell Beast, mentally guiding them toward him.\n\n\nCyndro saw that the bots he had been firing at were running, but he fired \nafter them with EMP blasts, seeking missiles, and normal laser fire. They \nwern&#39;t going to get away that easy! :)\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
