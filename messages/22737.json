Now she was going to bring \nback her leader. Hopefully, she would restore the order in the group.\n\nShe reached into the bin and raised up KitKat&#39;s arm.  She pulled out \nher dagger and cut off the index finder of her left hand.  She then \nput the arm down and closed the bin.  She put the finger in the \nmachine and turned it on.  The machine started to analize the DNA and \nstarted to regenerate the bot.  The computer would take a long time \nto take the venom from the DNA, but it would eventually create a new \nKitKat.  She smiled and went back to the bridge.\n\nShe sat back down in her chair and monitored the bots in the base.\n\n\n"}}
