My paint jobs baking in this heat!&quot; he complained as he \nsquatted \n&gt; down in Blue Flame&#39;s shadow to try and get out of the sun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Although Diesel Runner squinted out into the distance, her hands \non her \n&gt; hips. &quot; Maybe they&#39;re not coming.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sand Storm looked up at her with a flabbergasted expression from \nwatching a \n&gt; lady bug crawl over his foot. &quot; You can&#39;t be serious.
