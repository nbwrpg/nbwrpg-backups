I \nwill tell Kit Kat..you get started.&quot; \n  The two destrons sphink and his friend started to disassemble dark \nsentinel.  Whil Magnus and gabriel went out side and took down the autoguns. \nAll the while destructor sent a repeated mess to Kit Kat..&quot;We are moveing to \nthe new base. I know this is sudden but you will know why soon. The destrons \nflew off towards the chamber with dark sentinel.\n\n"}}
