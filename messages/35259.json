The mutant saw a flaw to her tactics, she had just\npinned herself between Kit Kat and the other Predacons.(remember Robo\nwhatever shots miss Silver Scout are headed towards Kit Kat2)\n\nBullet crossed his arms deflecting the shot. his arm singed from the impact.\n&quot;Be more carefull with that thing would you?&quot; he shouted toward Kit Kat.\nThere were to many bots in the halls to be endangered by friendly fire.\n\nBlaze aimed her disruptor, firing at the intruder three times.\n\nSilver Scout moved quickly as she could trying to avoid any further damage.\nTo many shots flew through the hallway to tell who was fireing or when.\nBlacknightmares stun blasts weakened her, Blazes disruptor scrambled her\ncircuitry, and Enders sidearms pierced her organics causing more of the\nstrange red energeon to flow from her form. She transformed to her hawk form\nand attempted to escape but no sooner had she left the ground that she lost\nher strength and collapsed back to the floor of the Black Fortress.\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: RoboRick007 &lt;rfa007@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 21, 2001 4:16 AM\nSubject: Re: Happanings at BlackFortress\n\n\n&gt; ::KitKat2::\n&gt;\n&gt; She was fliped over, but quickly back to her feet.
