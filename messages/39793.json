He realised that during all the\nchaos, two messages had elluded him.\n\nHe opened up the first one, to the IGL. \n\n&quot;Greetings, I am Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. I request and\naudience with you, personally.&quot; he inquired. He then turned to the\nother, it was on a secret Decepticons line. Who possibly knew of it, a\nMaximal trick, perhaps?\n\n&quot;He opened up a view screen, and attempted to connect with the D.E.D&#39;s.\n(If it&#39;s not all right, then tell me, and I will rewrite.)\n\nMegatron&#39;s face came to life on the screen, filling it up, as he looked\nback, at Scrapper. &quot;Scrapper? What are you doing?&quot; he said, more\ndisturbed than anything.\n\n"}}
