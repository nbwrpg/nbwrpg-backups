He first screamed out in pain. He \ncouldnt control his body, he was transforming randomly and not even in shapes \njust blobs of black silver goo. He struggled to control it. His spark pulsed \nand cringed. He exploded all his strength and he gained some sort of reality \nof himself. His skin became hard again. His body was compeltely black now. \nWith a silver decepticon symbol on his back and chest. He had two white eye \nsymbols on his face but no mouth opening though hed still be able to speak \ntelepathicly. He stood up and flexed. &quot;Ive never felt so alive! I am no longer \nproto my name is Carnatron!!&quot; he leaped off takeing incredibly long strides \ninto the air, tohughts ran through his head wondering what this...thing could \ndo.\n\n"}}
