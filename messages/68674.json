He stopped suddenly and with a slight roll on the ground,\nhe made a complete 180 and ran back toward base at double-speed.\n\nSeeing his pursuer was no longer distracted, Ravenchief turned around\nas well, hoping to draw the beast back away from the battle.\nSurprisingly, the predecon&#39;s speed was faster than his, even though he\nwas a flyer.\n\n&quot;Amazing, that dog-pred&#39;s groundspeed is faster than I can fly...\nuhhhh he&#39;s headed back your way chief.&quot; said Ravenchief over the\nMaximal radio channel.\n\n&quot;Just what we need...&quot; said Perseus, sounding annoyed.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nNarrowly escaping a volley of explosive rounds.  Finding another spot,\nLord Perseus looked around for another target.\n\nOOC:  sorry for the delay...been lazy about posting.  Could someone\ntell me who&#39;s still fighting outside and who is inside?\n\nOn 5/12/08, xochitla2006 &lt;xochitla2006@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Nightlight:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I surrender&quot;said the femme trying to hold back a sob &quot;Lead the way...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing had survived, tought bittery Nightlight, her sadness didnt\n&gt; allowed see his brieft hesitation.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
