His optic was\ngone, Blasted aw=\r\nay by the shot.\n\nDinobot: If you would be so kind as to offer me the hospit=\r\nality of one\nof your CR chambers, I would be more than grateful. But of cou=\r\nrse,\nthat will have to wait. As I promised, I have to reveal a lot of\nthing=\r\ns, Perseus. \n\nFarther, Doc was itchy with his rifle. He had quickly resight=\r\ned\nDinobot as he went down and did not move the barrel of his weapon by a\nm=\r\nillimeter.\n\nDoc: Rodimus, I really don&#39;t like this guy.
