Hydras appeared? How could it be? It \nwas a electronic puppet what was identically Hydras.\n\nFollowing the same idea as Megatron of Beast Wars, Perceptor did one \nto Hydras for one ocation as this. The control was simple: the chair \npicked up the signals of his torso and legs and send them to the \npuppet to move it. some special &quot;Gloves&quot; picked the signal of his \narms and hands, and as the &quot;Chair&quot; sent it to the puppet. A Special \nhelmet trasmited to receptor what the puppet see and heard and a \nmicrophone let receptor sent his voice to the puppet.\n\n&quot;AS you see &quot;hissed Hydras&quot;I was keeping this little puppet for \nocattions of this... Now here are my commands: YOu Inferno and \nQuickStrike will follow this puppet and will act as normally, as if \nthis thing is me... If this puppet it&#39;s destruyed you imediatly come \nback base... Waspinator will remain here with me... I might need you \nat hand...
