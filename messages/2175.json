She turned away from the water and Teltoli both at once with a loud snarl, she felt angry and silly both at the same time. Silly for acting so but angry that the memories just wouldn&#39;t leave her alone!\nCarnage began to walk away from the lake clearing, not quite in the forest yet. She had a lot to think about but none of it to do with talking about her problems. But in a sense she didn&#39;t want to really be alone either. She stopped just before entering into the forest, not even looking back at Teltoli she said...*\n\n&quot; If you wanna come with me you&#39;re welcome, but I have no idea where I&#39;m headed.&quot;\n\n* She just wanted to walk and try to forget and cool off. But a friend by her side to seek with if she ever wanted to was a good idea to her at the time.*\n\n\n____________________________________________________________________\nGet your free, permanent email  @..., the friendliest \naddress on the Net! \nhttp://penpalmail.www.com\n\nWant to make new friends all over the world?
