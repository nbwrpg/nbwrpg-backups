Anything\n&gt;enclosed in --&#39;s in my posts is &#39;thought speach&#39;, and Shadow Cat and\n&gt;Snow Tech (and anyone else) wouldn&#39;t even know it was going on, much\n&gt;less hear it. Prowl and Iron Raptor share sparks in a way, and with\n&gt;through that share emotions and thoughts.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
