It seemed hopeless, as Hell Beast \nwould have no mercy on him. Just then, Terminess called him over to \nher side of the room. She whipered to him.\n\n&quot;Listen, we&#39;re finished. Predacon trails are unfair, we know that. We \nare going to be convicted of treason, and we are going to die. So I \nhave an idea to go out fighting. Look.\n\nShe opens a compartment in her body where she was hiding a small box.\n\n&quot;This is an explosive. It contains c4 and other high explosives. It \nis so compacted that slightest touches could set it off. We could set \nit off in here. It would kill us in the process, but it would aslo \ntake out that other guy in the brig, the two guys guarding the door, \nand severly damage Hell Beast and the other Preds inside my lab. On \ntop of that, it would leave a gaping hole in the base, with a good \nchance that other factions would attack and seize the base. What do \nyou say?&quot;\n\nVulois thought about it. He could take on final swing at Hell Beast \nbefore he went.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Great. Now, normally the shields would keep the explosion inside \nthis room, but if we put it over in that corner, it would destroy \nthis room&#39;s shield generator, leaving it open.&quot;\n\nTerminess put the box down in the corner. Vulois sat down beside it, \nand thought about all the things he had done. His loyal Decepticon \nservice. Finding the Matrix. Coming here. Finding the TM3 Driver. \nMeeting Soundwave, Battera and Terminess. Then making his mistake: \nJoining Hell Beast.\n\nVulois punched the box, with all his strength, setting off the \nexplosion.\n\n(Now, this is almost the conclusion to the first part of Vulois. He&#39;s \nnot dead yet, don&#39;t worry. You can put Terminess down on the deceased \npage, she served her purpose. She doesn&#39;t technically &quot;die&quot; but we \nwon&#39;t see her anymore. As for Vulois, he will take a drastic change \ntomorrow, which will be my last post before vacation. Battera and \nSoundwave, get ready because it pertains to you.)\n\n\n\n"}}
