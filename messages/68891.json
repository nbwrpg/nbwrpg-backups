Join us!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Around him sweeps=\r\n manuvered, their movements agitated and\n&gt; &gt; aggressive \n&gt; &gt; as if they too=\r\n knew of the tense offer delivered to the\n&gt; &gt; Predicon \n&gt; &gt; commander.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Decibel floated nearby Cyclonus uncharacteristically\n&gt; &gt; silent, only =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; low chuckle coming from her vocators.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Grimlock, L=\r\nord Elder, and Legacy fired at the incoming\n&gt; &gt; sweeps, their \n&gt; &gt; firepowe=\r\nr combined with that of the shuttle and Ark is\n&gt; &gt; great indeed! \n&gt; &gt; Explo=\r\nsions dotted the skies as many sweeps attempted to\n&gt; &gt; dodge the \n&gt; &gt; fire =\r\nand are unsuccessful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However the sweeps were becoming more cagey =\r\nas the fight\n&gt; &gt; continued, \n&gt; &gt; as if they were learning from the deaths o=\r\nf the previous\n&gt; &gt; ones, \n&gt; &gt; becoming more skilled, even seeming to antici=\r\npate attacks! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Even Scorponok and Zarak are feeling these repercus=\r\nsions.\n&gt; &gt; Their \n&gt; &gt; attack from the rear bit a large sized hole in the mi=\r\nnion\n&gt; &gt; formation \n&gt; &gt; as the fusion cannon, rockets and machine guns rip =\r\ninto the\n&gt; &gt; mass. Yet \n&gt; &gt; for the G2 Decepticons it was like shaking a be=\r\ne-hive. At\n&gt; &gt; the first \n&gt; &gt; they had not been attacked as the Sweeps had =\r\nbeen ignoring \n&gt; &gt; Decepticons and Predicons, but that changed with this\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; attack! As more \n&gt; &gt; sweeps maneuvered through the air to fill in the hol=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; opened by \n&gt; &gt; Scorponok and Zarak, disintegration cannons opened fir=\r\ne on\n&gt; &gt; them, the \n&gt; &gt; air filling with a slight burning smell!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Jhiaxus and Myrmidon headed into the mass of the sweeps,\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; sweeps enfolded them, twisting and turning. The jets were\n&gt; &gt; more=\r\n agile \n&gt; &gt; then the sweeps, but the sweeps seemed to be well armored,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt; possesed a rather large numerical advantage. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shots are f=\r\nired on both sides, Jhiaxus and Myrmidon both\n&gt; &gt; taking down \n&gt; &gt; several =\r\nsweeps at a time, but these seem to be replaced by\n&gt; &gt; a \n&gt; &gt; seemingly end=\r\nless number of them. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Dark Rodimus arrived it was be=\r\ncoming obvious to the\n&gt; &gt; casual \n&gt; &gt; observer that even though many of the=\r\n sweeps had been\n&gt; &gt; destroyed, \n&gt; &gt; there were still many of them in the s=\r\nkies. The smell of\n&gt; &gt; burnt metal \n&gt; &gt; and alloy was begining to fill the =\r\nair, as smoke covered\n&gt; &gt; the ground \n&gt; &gt; obscuring vision of many. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; However even through all that the aerial form of Cyclonus\n&gt; &gt; stood out,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; resplendent and majestic, like an emperor looking over the\n&gt; &gt; land h=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; will soon conquer! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Dark Rodimus&#39; firepower reaches into=\r\n the skies,\n&gt; &gt; Cyclonus turned \n&gt; &gt; toward it as if at the last moment det=\r\necting it, but it is\n&gt; &gt; too late! \n&gt; &gt; Power ripped through his systems as=\r\n circuits are\n&gt; &gt; temporarily \n&gt; &gt; overloaded and his once pristine armor i=\r\ns singed, scorched\n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; pitted! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Inwardly Cyclonus smiled =\r\nas he knew who it was that did\n&gt; &gt; this: Rodimus \n&gt; &gt; had arrived!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Flipping through the skies by the power of the blast it\n&gt; &gt; took a moment =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for Cyclonus to regain his bearing in the air. As he\n&gt; &gt; leveled out, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; already sweeps were rallying to his aid, bringing their\n&gt; &gt; cannons to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; bear on Rodimus and opening up on him!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;NO!&quot; Cyclonus called=\r\n to them, his voice\n&gt; &gt; radiating power and \n&gt; &gt; authority.  &quot;He is mine!&quot; =\r\n he commanded as he\n&gt; &gt; launched twin \n&gt; &gt; incendiary missiles at Rodimus, =\r\nones that glowed like\n&gt; &gt; miniature twin \n&gt; &gt; suns, as they seemed to almos=\r\nt glide foward toward Rodimus!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;It is time!&quot; barked Scou=\r\nrge across the minion\n&gt; &gt; communication network, \n&gt; &gt; even as he watched hi=\r\ns commander and friend get pulled into\n&gt; &gt; the fray. \n&gt; &gt; His gruff voice c=\r\nrackled in the ears of Nightstrike,\n&gt; &gt; Darkfate and \n&gt; &gt; Tummult. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; With a single command sweeps pulled out and away, launching\n&gt; &gt; from the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; center of the group. They did not target Rodimus or the\n&gt; &gt; Decepticon=\r\ns! \n&gt; &gt; Instead nearly a third of the remaining sweep moved at\n&gt; &gt; their pr=\r\nimary \n&gt; &gt; target, led by Scourge, and Tummult (and Darkfate and\n&gt; &gt; Nights=\r\ntrike??), \n&gt; &gt; with cannons blazing they pushed towards the ARK!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nreston\n&gt; &gt; (Da&#39;minion)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
