She fired at one of the top auto-guns and smiled as it exploded,\nshe\n&gt; HAD done a good job rewiring this weapon!\n&gt; BrightBlade looked over at the others as they continued to attack the Ark,\n&gt; were they having as much fun as she was?\n&gt; She sighed, when were the Maximals going to come out and play? She&#39;d love\nto\n&gt; have a chance to shoot at one of them rather then an auto-gun, or maybe\neven\n&gt; have a chance to sneak inside and get the drop on a few.\n&gt; BrightBlade snickered, she was going to enjoy this! :)\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Was the salesman clueless?
