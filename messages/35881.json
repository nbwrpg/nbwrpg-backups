She searched\n&gt; &gt; through her DNA samples and decided to use Scorpion and Snake DNA fused\nwith\n&gt; &gt; theAlien DNA Zardus had provided. A small pool of DNA sat before her,\n&gt; &gt; already beginning to grow. Much like Doctor Frankenstein she was\ncreating a\n&gt; &gt; monster and didn&#39;t even know it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
