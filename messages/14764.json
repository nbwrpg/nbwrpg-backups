But I have to stay here. If you wanna look at the\n&gt; Ark I&#39;m sure the ship logs have the info you&#39;ll need on it. All you would\n&gt; need to do is defend it if it fell under attack and protect the repair\ncrew\n&gt; as they worked. Nothing more.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * She then looked up in time to see Silverbolt walk into the room,\nwondering\n&gt; just what he was there for.\n&gt; But when she hears him speak she simply leanes back a bit.*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind if you also helped defend the Ark when I send the\n&gt; repair team to it. But it won&#39;t be for a bit.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
