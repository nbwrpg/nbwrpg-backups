Cardhead, WingedWarrior fill me in on what&#39;s\nhappened to my chars.  Also I have a question that may\ntake some debating.  I was thinking of introducing a\nnew race of transformers not from Cybertron (no not\nthe Junkions and I&#39;m not stupid enough to try to bring\nin the Minicons), but the char I&#39;m thinking of\ncreating arguably breaks the no invincibility rule. \nSee he&#39;s the textbook case prince hiding from his evil\nuncle who wants to take over his planet, but he has\nthis mark on his right hand that proves he&#39;s heir to\nthe throne.  The thing is when he&#39;s pushed to far the\nsymbol glows, andhe becomes invincible with limitless\nfirepower, speed, and strength, but it only lasts for\nabout twenty seconds then he turns back into himself,\nexcept then he&#39;s barely concious from the strain. \nStill in that time he could take out three or four\nbots or render a bases shields useless.  So is this\no.k. (please note this would be a rare occurance, not\nsomething that would appear in every battle).\n\n--- &quot;Nic &lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt;&quot;\n&lt;wingedwarrior41@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Happy birthday Kyle!
