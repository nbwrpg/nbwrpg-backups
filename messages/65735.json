The sky was cloudy, and it was\nobvious that there=\r\n would be a storm before nightfall.\nThe first sonic bang made the monkeys s=\r\ncramble away from the shore, so\nthat they were away when the second and thi=\r\nrd came. Then the great\nflash of light brightened the whole place and the c=\r\nar came out of\nnowhere until it stopped... right into a tree. The car was c=\r\novered in\na thin film of ice, but beneath that, it seemed to be an assortme=\r\nnt of\nrandom parts punched up together. The crash hadn&#39;t made its condition=\r\n\nany better. The front of the hood was bashed and it would need a\nthourough=\r\n body repair.\nThe car moaned from pain and confusion, then transformed. The=\r\n robot\nwas tall and lanky, and did not seem fully connected with reality. I=\r\nt\nlooked at its arm and punched something on a control panel, then\npressed =\r\nrecord, and began talking while checking data.\n&quot;The experience did not seem=\r\n to be a complete success, as something\ntells me that this is nowhere near =\r\nthe year 526 on colony Occitan.\nThis is not a cybertronian planet at all, a=\r\ns my arrival landed in a\ntree. When am I now? Maybe I should also say where=\r\n am I now? Great\nScotts! Could it be possible that my time travel experienc=\r\ne resulted\nin the discovery of teleportation? My arrival here is at an unnk=\r\nown\ntime, unknown year, and possibly unknown place.

WHAT AND =\r\nWHEN THE DEVIL IS\nTHIS PLACE?!?!?!?&quot;\n\nA bleep showed up on his display and =\r\nhe was suddenly silenced, when he\ntried to send a communication.\n\n&quot;I can&#39;t =\r\ninteract without possibly changing the space-time\ncontinuum...
