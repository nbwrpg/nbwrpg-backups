She looked at \nRowdy one last time. Then back to Megatron. &quot;AS you command.&quot;  She \nran back headed back to the base.  While running back through the \nwoods she taked to herself. &quot;What is wrong with me.  I&#39;m hearing \nvoices from no where and telling Megatron to follow them? I must be \nloosing my logic circuits or something.  I&#39;m going nuts, that&#39;s all \nthere is to it. I&#39;m loosing my mind.  I just got promoted and he&#39;ll \ndemote me for sure.&quot;  she ran back to the base.\n\nDarkMouse::\nShe sighed, and looked at the drone.  She was feeling better, but at \nteh same time, feeling useless.  She was a fighter and computer \ncontroller.  Sitting in her room, and it was spectacular compared to \nher last one, she still felt bad about not being able to fight yet.\n\n\n--- In nbwrpg@egroups.com, JP3884@a... wrote:\n&gt;     Megatron looked Kitkat up and down. He grew very bored with her \nantics \n&gt; very quickly. &quot;Both of you return to base now! we will settle it \nthere. Here \n&gt; were in the open.&quot;\n&gt;     Also, as insurence, he took out his tail gun and ignited the \npurple \n&gt; plasma that fuled it. If Kitkat decided to bail, she was going to \ndo it in \n&gt; peices.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Aracnia listened to Darkmouse and nodded. The Medical drone \nentered, \n&gt; saluted, and began to run its programmed diagnostic on her. Aracnia \nwould \n&gt; later open the gym up for the mouse, it would allow her to warm her \nbody up \n&gt; for a battle if needed.\n\n\n"}}
