She tried as hard as she cold to try to connect to \nLunarpine, but couldn&#39;t find a connection.  She felt alone and \nhelpless.  She couldn&#39;t defend herself without a body, but she didn&#39;t \nwant to give up.  She tried again to connect with Lunarpine, but \nstill couldn&#39;t find a connection.  She felt her spark fall and she \nhad no choice but to give up and wait.\n\n\n"}}
