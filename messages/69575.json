While he may have looked something like the old Rodimus Prime, his colors=\r\n were darker, black the old Rodimus was red, and a white hot flame on his c=\r\nhest, rather then the yellow. His weapons and form look sharp, sleeker and =\r\nmore meancing as he stood with his arms folded over his chest, his optics f=\r\nocused on a particular target. \n\nThrough thick protective glass Dark Rodimu=\r\ns could see the form of Nightlight, who at the moment lay unconscious in he=\r\nr cell. His thoughts were dark and moody as he observed her, he could see t=\r\nhe low level pulsing of energon flowing through her system as she lay there=\r\n. \n\nOn one level he knew that she was his wife and the mother of a child - =\r\nHIS child. He had trouble grasping that. He knew some of these things, but =\r\nit was as if these memories belonged to someone else, some other Rodimus. T=\r\nhey held no emotional attachment to him - and yet here he was standing here=\r\n watching her and not knowing what to do. \n\nHe hated not knowing what to do=\r\n. A glanced away and looked over at the lift doors, as he figured Hydras wo=\r\nuld be waiting for him in the throne room. Yet there was something that had=\r\n pulled him here. \n\nWith a scowl he turned away from Nightlight and began w=\r\nalking towards the lift, he would worry about it later. Right now he had bi=\r\ngger fish to fry. \n\nWith a last glance back at Nightlight he began to walk.=\r\n \n\nPreston\n(Rodimus)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
