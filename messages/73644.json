She left her babies in the bed and starte to work&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot;&gt;nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Sandra Panico &lt;magicquartz@&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tucson heaves a sigh.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; I meant to call Rodimu=\r\ns, Perceptor, Rattrap and Windlord back to the ark in an alternate fashion =\r\nrather than the con link. I&#39;m sensing another interruption in our communica=\r\ntions system. I apologize if I&#39;ve startled any of you close by. Still no wo=\r\nrd from them.. Surely they would have heard that. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was now very concerned for the welfare of Rodi=\r\nmus, Windlord, Perceptor and Rattrap. He gives Talon the babies once more a=\r\nnd gets back into beast mode.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot; Leo, watch over operations while I&#39;m gone. Lord Elder, inform me at o=\r\nnce if you hear anything pertaining to Rodimus and the others. I know where=\r\n I must go, but do not know what I will find. &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He gives Talon a gentile rub on her face with his sno=\r\nut and does the same for his babies.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &quot; Stay strong for me, I will return as soon as I can. That&#39;s a p=\r\nromise.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He now walks out =\r\nwith a stern stride and extends his wings, lifting himself off the ground, =\r\nstirring up debris in mini cyclones around him as he takes flight. His armo=\r\nr shimmers brilliantly as it catches the light of the sky, appearing almost=\r\n like lightning as his long tail trails behind him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once in the air, he gives another beacon roar, ev=\r\nen louder than the first, to see if Rodimus and the others can hear him. Th=\r\nis intern sounds just like a boom of thunder which has a habit of rattling =\r\nthe ground somewhat. Yes there be a dragon soaring over the skies as Tucson=\r\ns shadow is cast over the entrance of the cave where the Enemy was last see=\r\nn. Another booming roar confirms his arrival as he circles the area.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Local artist who specializes in =\r\nillustration, using traditional and digital media. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also specialize in hand made crafts.
