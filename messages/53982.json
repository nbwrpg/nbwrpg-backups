He picks her up into his arms, along with the baby. \n&gt; Rodimus Prime: Well we should go to our quarters, love. You need to rest and the \n&gt; baby will need an Ionic shower(I&#39;m stealing things from Star Trek again). \n&gt; Rodimus walks out of the Sick Bay, holding his family, and heads for his \n&gt; quarters. \n&gt; A lot was on his mind right now. So much had happened recently. His falling in \n&gt; love with Nightlight, the birth of their daughter, it was all good. He had a \n&gt; family. However he was still the General Commander of a Maximal force in the \n&gt; middle of the Neo Beast Wars. Not to mention that he was the Matrix&#39;s &quot;Chosen \n&gt; One,&quot; Rodimus Prime. That meant that no telling how many past Decepticons and \n&gt; Predacons wanted him dead.
