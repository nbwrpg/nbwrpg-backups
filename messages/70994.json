I did delete that post and I rewrote it. Tucson h=\r\nasn&#39;t\n&gt; moved, he&#39;s signalled Noctorro to move in slowly, and in phases. He=\r\n&#39;s going\n&gt; to now stand back and let the fuzors begin their work. But he&#39;s =\r\nalso going\n&gt; to give the impression of complete surrender at the same time.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Meanwhile, Uproar and Quickstride are completely at a loss as to how t=\r\no fix\n&gt; things at the Ark. And now, they&#39;re going to look up to Rodimus to =\r\ndo the\n&gt; right thing. Both of them are rookie Maximals, so do expect some c=\r\nomic\n&gt; relief from those two. Uproars biggest weakness is his perpetual cur=\r\niosity\n&gt; which is harmless enough but often gets him into sticky situations=\r\n.\n&gt; Quickstride&#39;s weakness is often his scatterbrained nature, which also\n&gt;=\r\n provides a little comic relief. If Rodimus can put these two guys on the\n&gt;=\r\n right track, then he shouldn&#39;t have any reasons to doubt himself as a\n&gt; le=\r\nader.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps. BTW, Tucson is willing to meet with Legacy, on n=\r\neutral\n&gt; grounds, but feels it&#39;s best that Legacy does leave the Ark for sa=\r\nftey\n&gt; purposes. Remember, he does have that weakness for losing his temper=\r\n, and he\n&gt; may have made it sound rather harsh, when he informed Legacy tha=\r\nt he was to\n&gt; vacate the Ark. But in doing so, he could privately meet with=\r\n the bot to try\n&gt; and get an idea as to what page he&#39;s actually on, and why=\r\n he&#39;s doing what\n&gt; he&#39;s doing. And if he has indeed turned evil. Tucson is =\r\nextremely confused\n&gt; as to why Legacy would intentionally harm his comrades=\r\n, and he&#39;s hiding\n&gt; confusion behind his anger. But he will not make any vi=\r\nolent actions against\n&gt; him, he just wants honest answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Okay, that&#39;s=\r\n definitely it for now. Haven&#39;t gone this far yet, just\n&gt; something to run =\r\nby you before we go with it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com &lt;nbwrpg%40=\r\nyahoogroups.com&gt;, Super Cyclonus\n&gt; &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: =\r\nOkay, I am confused.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sandy I am not trying to be critical, so pleas=\r\ne don&#39;t take it that way,\n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; your post is sort of unfair. You start =\r\nyour post with Tuscon in the\n&gt; middle\n&gt; &gt; of a very tense stand off with hi=\r\nm being defensless and you end it with\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; being on the way to the Ar=\r\nk. Basically you made no allowance for someone,\n&gt; &gt; presumably Hydras, to s=\r\ntop Tuscon from leaving - which is what most evil\n&gt; bad\n&gt; &gt; guys would do.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In message #70973 the demand was that the Maximals and Autobots lay=\r\n down\n&gt; &gt; thier weapons if they wanted Nightlight to live.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In messa=\r\nge #70975 Tuscon gives the order for all the Maximals and such to\n&gt; &gt; compl=\r\ny. And in that post you write that Night Shift subspaces his weapon,\n&gt; as\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Straight Shot transforms into her robot mode, disarming her own weaponry=\r\n\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; well.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In message #70978 Tuscon lays down his weapon and i=\r\nn Message #70987 Kup\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; Talon do the same.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This would mean t=\r\nhat all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are\n&gt; now\n&gt; &gt; weaponless,=\r\n and so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much of the\n&gt; &gt; Predacon =\r\narmy is standing there, either in front of them, or flying over\n&gt; &gt; head. I=\r\n had posted that the preds were picking up those discarded weapons\n&gt; &gt; whil=\r\ne other were watching.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However in message #70988 Tuscon is able to =\r\npick up a weapon, aim it at\n&gt; &gt; someone, then with the help of the other Ma=\r\nximals choose not to fire,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; are able to talk back and forth a few=\r\n times, salute each other and then\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon drives off with no one stoppi=\r\nng him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How do we reconcile all of that? Since you already had Tusc=\r\non sending\n&gt; &gt; messages out and your characters already responding, if we h=\r\nad someone\n&gt; stop\n&gt; &gt; you in the middle of all of that, it would make it co=\r\nnfusing as to what\n&gt; &gt; happened and what didn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tuscon should not =\r\nhave been able to point a weapon, talk, transform and\n&gt; &gt; drive away with n=\r\no response. Does that make sense? Anything we post in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; middle of t=\r\nhat would only confuse things worse.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We might need some editing. Li=\r\nke Tuscon just does the first part of that,\n&gt; &gt; but not leave yet. Allow th=\r\ne rest of us to post a response first, then if\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; is reasonable based=\r\n on the responses he leaves?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Again, not trying to to be critical, b=\r\nut keeping it fair.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Jan 22, 201=\r\n1 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; OOC: I d=\r\nid an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back in.

In the darkness their sh=\r\napes could\n&gt; only be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barely made out, but they looked like black me=\r\ntallic spiders, Hydras&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guardians!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC:=\r\n Rat Trap may recognize them from last time.

He =\r\ngives Quickstride a quizzical look as the\n&gt; equine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal sniffed =\r\nhim.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals nothing wrong.)\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was about to let Quickstride in on what he had planned when =\r\nUproar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar&#39;s con=\r\nclusion\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was Legacy that had turned evil. While Rodi=\r\nmus didn&#39;t know that much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy, having only seen him =\r\nbriefly while being rescued and\n&gt; repaired,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was nothing=\r\n to hint that this attack was Legacy&#39;s doing. He was about\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; something when Uproar ran towards the Ark to be let in . . .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;KRACK POW&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Uproar ran towards the Ark, what se=\r\nemed like a round bolt of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lightening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appeared, sending Uproar=\r\n flying several yards through the air, to\n&gt; land\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heavily on the gro=\r\nund! Evidently the Ark shielding was still in\n&gt; place,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n was not allowing anyone in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus frowned, &quot;Uproar! Get =\r\nover here! If we are going to get back\n&gt; in,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we need to work t=\r\nogether. That shield is supposed to hold off\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Predac=\r\non forces.

His body was powerfully\n&gt; built\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and heavil=\r\ny armored. He looked to turn into a lion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The third was Ram=\r\nulus (http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ramulus) who had like\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others bee=\r\nn on patrol for a while, surveying the area and trying to\n&gt; keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; free from Predacon invasion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They also come up besid=\r\ne Rodimus, Leo II, obviously the leader of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two, &quot;Wh=\r\nat now sir?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rodimus looked at Quickstride and Uproar, &quot;Wel=\r\nl let&#39;s get out of\n&gt; sight,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we can discuss it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Meanwhile Inside the Ark:*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perceptor had recei=\r\nved Tuscon&#39;s message and sent attempted to send a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\nLord elder, however at the moment there was no answer from the\n&gt; elder\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Maximal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the same time Legacy was still standing in =\r\nthe med lab along with\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others, his single optic glowing in th=\r\ne darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It would seem that Nightlight&#39;s vital systems =\r\nare being held at\n&gt; minimal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; levels.&quot; Legacy said as he directed his=\r\n gaze to the wall panel\n&gt; nearest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nightlight. A small light blinked=\r\n, indicating her spark was still\n&gt; online,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that there was not e=\r\nnough power to reboot her systems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He turned to look at the=\r\n others, his face glowing in the darkness,\n&gt; lit by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his own optic, =\r\nand the glowing bar on his chest plate. He raised his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nand in the air, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\night\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the room =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated. He casually looked around, &quot;Perhaps we could locat=\r\ne a\n&gt; back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or reserve power system . . . &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Legacy paused as Tuscon&#39;s message came in. He turned to look at\n&gt; Santon,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bump\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Perceptor, a look of disbelief momentarily flashing=\r\n across his\n&gt; face.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Legacy straightened as his cold voice c=\r\nomes across the channel, &quot;I\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comply with your comma=\r\nnd.

He=\r\n turned\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the others, his single optic cold, &quot;It i=\r\ns illogical to believe\n&gt; that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would attempt to harm the Ark or al=\r\nlow anyone to take it from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximals.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (TAG)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Preston\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0022150490bf5bb234049a9db4a8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nSounds good, and as far as what Tuscon intends, I don&#39;t mind running wi=\r\nth that intention and seeing where things land :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will let Airly =\r\npost for Hydras and crew before I post. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and I sent you some pri=\r\nvate email :)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Preston&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On=\r\n Sun, Jan 23, 2011 at 8:16 PM, Sandy &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:magicquartz@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;magicquartz@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left: 1px =\r\nsolid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;You were righ=\r\nt.  I did delete that post and I rewrote it.  Tucson hasn&#39;t moved, he&#=\r\n39;s signalled Noctorro to move in slowly, and in phases.  He&#39;s going t=\r\no now stand back and let the fuzors begin their work.  But he&#39;s also go=\r\ning to give the impression of complete surrender at the same time.  &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nMeanwhile, Uproar and Quickstride are completely at a loss as to how t=\r\no fix things at the Ark.  And now, they&#39;re going to look up to Rodimus =\r\nto do the right thing.  Both of them are rookie Maximals, so do expect some=\r\n comic relief from those two.  Uproars biggest weakness is his perpetual cu=\r\nriosity which is harmless enough but often gets him into sticky situations.=\r\n  Quickstride&#39;s weakness is often his scatterbrained nature, which also=\r\n provides a little comic relief.  If Rodimus can put these two guys on the =\r\nright track, then he shouldn&#39;t have any reasons to doubt himself as a l=\r\neader.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nHope this helps. BTW, Tucson is willing to meet with Lega=\r\ncy, on neutral grounds, but feels it&#39;s best that Legacy does leave the =\r\nArk for saftey purposes.  Remember, he does have that weakness for losing h=\r\nis temper, and he may have made it sound rather harsh, when he informed Leg=\r\nacy that he was to vacate the Ark.  But in doing so, he could privately mee=\r\nt with the bot to try and get an idea as to what page he&#39;s actually on,=\r\n and why he&#39;s doing what he&#39;s doing.  And if he has indeed turned e=\r\nvil.  Tucson is extremely confused as to why Legacy would intentionally har=\r\nm his comrades, and he&#39;s hiding confusion behind his anger.  But he wil=\r\nl not make any violent actions against him, he just wants honest answers.  =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nOkay, that&#39;s definitely it for now.    Haven&#39;t gone thi=\r\ns far yet, just something to run by you before we go with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nbwrpg%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;n=\r\nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Super Cyclonus &lt;supercyclonus@...&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&gt; OOC: Okay, I am confused.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Sandy I am not trying to be critical, so please don&#39;t t=\r\nake it that way, but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; your post is sort of unfair. You start your p=\r\nost with Tuscon in the middle&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of a very tense stand off with him b=\r\neing defensless and you end it with him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; being on the way to the Ar=\r\nk.  Basically you made no allowance for someone,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; presumably Hydras=\r\n, to stop Tuscon from leaving - which is what most evil bad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guys w=\r\nould do.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In message #70973 the demand was that the Maxim=\r\nals and Autobots lay down&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; thier weapons if they wanted Nightlight =\r\nto live.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In message #70975 Tuscon gives the order for al=\r\nl the Maximals and such to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; comply. And in that post you write that=\r\n Night Shift subspaces his weapon, as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Straight Shot transforms int=\r\no her robot mode, disarming her own weaponry as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; well.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In message #70978 Tuscon lays down his weapon and in Message #70987 =\r\nKup and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Talon do the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This would mean that=\r\n all of the Maximals and Autobots in that area are now&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; weaponless,=\r\n and so pretty much defenceless. At the same time much of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Pred=\r\nacon army is standing there, either in front of them, or flying over&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; head. I had posted that the preds were picking up those discarded weapon=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; while other were watching.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; However in message=\r\n #70988 Tuscon is able to pick up a weapon, aim it at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; someone, the=\r\nn with the help of the other Maximals choose not to fire, they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are=\r\n able to talk back and forth a few times, salute each other and then&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Tuscon drives off with no one stopping him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; How do we=\r\n reconcile all of that? Since you already had Tuscon sending&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; messa=\r\nges out and your characters already responding, if we had someone stop&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; you in the middle of all of that, it would make it confusing as to wha=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; happened and what didn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Tuscon should n=\r\not have been able to point a weapon, talk, transform and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; drive awa=\r\ny with no response. Does that make sense? Anything we post in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nmiddle of that would only confuse things worse.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; We might=\r\n need some editing. Like Tuscon just does the first part of that,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nbut not leave yet. Allow the rest of us to post a response first, then if i=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is reasonable based on the responses he leaves?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Again, not trying to to be critical, but keeping it fair.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Preston&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 22, 2011 at 7:58 AM, Sandy &lt;magicquartz@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; OOC: I d=\r\nid an edit but I guess I&#39;ll add Uproar back in.

Keep in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mind that yo=\r\nu have but a limited time to change your mind and comply with my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; demands!

I hate that I&#39;m =\r\nable ta do this. My ears just caught a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transmission from Tucs=\r\non Prime. He&#39;s heading back, and judging by the tone&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of h=\r\nis voice, he&#39;s in a beast of a mood. Said someth&#39;n about ousting Le=\r\ngacy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the hard way. I hate ta see what that entails..&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Uproar grins kiddingly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &quot;And I thought my temper was nasty.

He gives Quickstrid=\r\ne a quizzical look as the equine&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maximal sniffed him.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (OOC: Quickstride&#39;s sniff reveals n=\r\nothing wrong.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was about to let Qu=\r\nickstride in on what he had planned when Uproar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appeared=\r\n. Rodimus appears taken aback though by Uproar&#39;s conclusion that&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was Legacy that had turned evil.

A small light blin=\r\nked, indicating her spark was still online,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but that the=\r\nre was not enough power to reboot her systems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; He turned to look at the others, his face glowing in the darkness=\r\n, lit by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his own optic, and the glowing bar on his chest=\r\n plate. He raised his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; right&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hand in the ai=\r\nr, the one with the arm cannon on it and begin to emit&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; light&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from it, much like a flash light or a beacon so that the=\r\n room was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illuminated.
