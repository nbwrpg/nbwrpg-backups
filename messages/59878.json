Interfacing with the\n&gt; computers, and uploading the image of him, the\n&gt; computer fed me back his data file. As for finding out\n&gt; about his claims, I secretly hid a bug not far from\n&gt; the Maximal base in case it yielded anything about the\n&gt; new bot. As it transmits its signal back through\n&gt; subspace, the orbital interference array was not an\n&gt; issue.&quot; Darkangel patiently awaited his leader&#39;s\n&gt; reply.\n&gt; \n&gt;  --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; OOC: Lol!

A major wildcard is a Maximal\n&gt; &gt; warrior by the name of Shadowcaster who according to\n&gt; &gt; all records died defending the Ark during Megatron&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; attack using the Nemesis. He claims to be sent back\n&gt; &gt; from the Matrix by Primus, whic if true means he\n&gt; could\n&gt; &gt; well be a good option to turn to should the weapon\n&gt; &gt; fail. On the other hand, if this is really a hoax by\n&gt; &gt; Unicron then I fear we are all in danger. Assuming\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; is the spawn of Unicron, even if we were able to\n&gt; foil\n&gt; &gt; his ruse, he is as powerful as Optimal Optimus,\n&gt; &gt; however, much faster, and with cloaking\n&gt; capabilities.\n&gt; &gt; Whatever the case, it would seem that our problems\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; increasing.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  --- Nic &lt;Proudwing500k@h...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Tyrael was grave yet again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tyrael: A file appeared.
