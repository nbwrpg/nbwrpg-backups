The sheilds were \nraised, and autoguns armed. With the freash scourch marks on the hull it \nseems there might have been a rescent battle.\n    &quot;Now this is where i take command of my former troops. Watch and you \nmight lern something, Major Gremlin.&quot; Hell Beast gloated as he reached his \ncomm unit, &quot;This is Predacon Senetor and Commander Hell Beast. I have \nreturned to retake command of the Predacon forces. Open the hatch now! Thats \nan order!&quot; He barked.\n    \n    Aracnia slapped herself on the head. First Megatron and now Hell Beast. \nAnd Hell Beast was going to take command. &quot;Alright, let him in. Quickstrike, \ngo to the hatch and meet him there. The rest of you finish up cleaning and \nhurry! Darkmouse, you go and scout out where Megatron is hiding, then radio \nus back so we can get Inferno. Hurry!&quot; She said picking up debris along with \nRampage, Tarantulas, Aerostreak, and Paralysis.\n\n    Megatron, Aquarious, Paddle Tail, Night Eyes, and an unconscience \nInferno, and hopefully Terrorsaur made it to the cave. They entered easil and \nfound Waspinator reclining on the Command Chair enjoying himself.\n    &quot;Trechorous bug! You left me to die!&quot; He snapped at the bot. Waspinator \nspun around and dropped to his knees.\n    &quot;Megatron! Slug bot said you were dead! He went to go and salvage some \nparts from the transport.&quot; Waspinator said in his annoying bug voice.\n    The tyrant sa on the command chair and turned to the monitors, &quot;Well, \nthis is our place now. And with Inferno we can now commence the cloning. It \nwill take awhile....but with the clones we will dominate the Beast Wars once \nand for all!&quot;\n\n"}}
