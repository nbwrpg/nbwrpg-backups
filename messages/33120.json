He ussually keeps fighting until all potential enemies are \n&gt; dead, or he is ordered. Big post here people. Also sorry Soulstice, \n&gt; since you didnt post with him in a while, I didnt know you wanted \n&gt; something to do. Dcoburn, what happened to Surgital ?\n&gt; \n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Megatron nodded to Autofire, &quot;Ah yessss, about your payment, I will \n&gt; talk to you about that when you return with the potential soldier. \n&gt; There will also be a bonus involved,&quot; He then turned his attention to \n&gt; Dive-Bomb, &quot;Dive-Bomb, Razorclaw can handle that, acompany Autofire \n&gt; here,&quot; he then turned towards the base. &quot;Triggerhappy, Skullgrin, get \n&gt; out here, I have a new job for you to do,&quot; He then turned to Cepta, \n&gt; &quot;Ahhh yesss, Welcome to the Decepticons, I am Megatron&quot; he said in an \n&gt; awfully ellegant and ettiquette, &quot;Would you like a tour of the base?&quot; \n&gt; He asks.\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; Firedrill looked at First Aid funny, like he should know him, &quot;It&#39;s me \n&gt; Firedrill&quot; he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cliffjumper first noticed Halucigen leave, and then turned around, \n&gt; Abominus was big time. He new that the gestalt fighting him would need \n&gt; to turn it up a notch to take him out. He still wasnt sure what to do, \n&gt; so he walked towards Beachcomber again.\n&gt; \n&gt; OOC: Thanks Kslaw, I was a bit confused.\n&gt; BIC:\n&gt; \n&gt; Headstrong loomed over First-Aid, &quot;Well well *snort* if it isnt the \n&gt; pacifist, you Protectobots sure can&#39;t cut it can you&quot; he mocked, as he \n&gt; raised his sword for another strike. Just then Firedrill leapt into \n&gt; him, shoulder first. The force of the tackle sent them both back. \n&gt; Firedrill landed to his feet in front of the Predacon, &quot;Just like a \n&gt; Decepticon to attack a defensless robot&quot; he spat, showing discust. \n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll tach you what a Decepticon is like *snort*&quot; Headstrong retorted \n&gt; furiously.\n\n\n"}}
