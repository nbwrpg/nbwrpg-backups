He knew Slugslinger was to low on energy to do any\nfancy maneuvers, heck, they probably wouldnt make it to the ground in\none piece.\n\nThen as if to accent SLugslinger&#39;s thoughts, Grimlock fired another\nblast of super heated laser breath, which rocked Slugslinger, and put a\nhole in his wing. Grimlock looked back at Dion smugly.\n\n&quot;That how we do it. Not bad for autobot.&quot; Grimlock snarled down.\n\nSlugslinger tried to regain his ballance, and circle back, as not to\nleave Tremor alone, but Strafe was just trying not to go down, and both\njets collided, creating a huge metal grinding on metal noise, as they\nripped into each other, and then headed towards the rock hard ground.\nThey both landed unpleasantly, as Slugslinger tried to transform, but\nhis body not responding. Caliburst did however, and fired his laser at\nthe Transforming Strafe, who was still dizy from the crash.\n\nThe impact of the laser sent Strafe falling backwards, a smoking wound\non his chest, as he hit the ground. Caliburst then turned to\nSlugslinger. \n\n&quot;Where are you hurt?&quot; he asked visibly worried, but not so much about\nSlugslinger, as the hord of Autobots.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nNightmare listened to the message. If his helmet like face was capable\nof showing emotion, he would have been very interested.\n\n&quot;Do ya hear that, a fight.&quot; Jagged snarled excitedly. &quot;We should go, and\nwin it for the D.E.D.&quot;\n\nNightmare simply nodded his head. This was the chance of a lifetime for\nhis military training, and Jagged could use some experience. He stepped\nback, and transformed into his huge demonic horse mode. Stomping his\nhooves on the ground, causing the base to shake. Jagged climbed up on\nthe metalic saddle, and grabbed hold of two of the spikes on Nightmares\nneck, as the huge horse began to flap his metalic wings, to take off.\n\n"}}
