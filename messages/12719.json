But getting \ntheir, with the damage now, is going to be hard. I take two transport \npods and rearrange parts to make them one big one, with alot of \nstorage space. With double the engines, she can make it to \nouterspace. The problem would be that she would burn up entering and \nleaving the atmosphere. I would have to take a small piece of the \nouter hull of the ark to cover it up with. Except that would leave it \neven more disabled for a few hours. And their is the chance that it \nwill still burn up and the mission will be for nothing. But by the \nlooks of things it&#39;s our only hope. So this is what I suggest. You \ntwo start getting together troops. I&#39;ll start making the pod. I&#39;m \nalmpost done working on the CR Chambers, so I could start the pod \ntoday. When my friend Fliq get out, he&#39;ll help me. In a few days when \nI&#39;ve put it all together, him and I will take it up, since it&#39;s our \nproject. You two take the troops and attack, or hold steady and \nfortify, which ever you want. You give us a list of what to bring \nback, and we search for it. What do you say?&quot;\n\n\n"}}
