I checked my spam folder too, nothing was \n&gt;&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, what we got going on is pretty good so far.  It&#39;ll take a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; little\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time but it&#39;ll play out good.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BIC: Collective post.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Tucson Prime knew he had his work cut out for him.  It wouldn&#39;t be easy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attempting to turn Rodimus around.  He simply sighs, and does not give\n&gt;&gt; &gt; anyone the satisfaction of losing his temper.  The less he expressed \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; disdain, the more he hoped to cause a bit of frustration among his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; captives.  He had an old saying.  &quot;Don&#39;t get mad, use your strongest of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attributes and talents to passively retaliate against your enemies.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Ohh well, I may be in trouble for a while, and it wouldn&#39;t be the \n&gt;&gt; &gt; first\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He shrugs Rodimus off casually.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Outside the fortress, Rat Trap gets Lord Elder&#39;s message, and replies.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Lord Elder, sorry for not gettn&#39; back ta ya so soon.  We had a little\n&gt;&gt; &gt; glitch in our battle plans...  Tucson Prime told us ta stay outside the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fortress, and we did, and when he went inside with Kup ta try&#39;n get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nightshift out, he got captured, again.  But this time I think he \n&gt;&gt; &gt; wanted\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ta get captured..  Some sorta new strategy he&#39;s tryn&#39; out.  As for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; us...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I - dunno but Quickstride&#39;s got that look in his eyes.. He&#39;s itchn&#39; for \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fight. Normally I would just stay out of it, but, ya know somethn&#39;, I&#39;m\n&gt;&gt; &gt; itchn&#39; for some payback too.  Wheels is in there and he&#39;s givn&#39; it his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; all!  The least we can do is return the favor and do our part out here.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; We&#39;ll keep the com link open sir, so that way ya know we&#39;re still with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ya.... Nowwwww, let&#39;s see, I&#39;m on your back Quickstride and when you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; get\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your hooves movn&#39; you get &#39;em movn&#39;...  All we need is a long piece of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; metal and we got ourselves a lance...  Get my drift?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride nodds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; My charge, your lance....  Ohhh yeahh I do.  The old Jousting game. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remember, as Maximals, we don&#39;t make any moves unless we&#39;re attacked\n&gt;&gt; &gt; first.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap nodds.  He spots something.  A long pipe like object that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; appears\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to be a broken off piece of pipe from some form of fallen aircraft.  It\n&gt;&gt; &gt; proves to not have rusted and in good condition.  He scans the ground \n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; finds what looks like a pointed missile head, perhaps from a missile \n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; had not fired.  He puts the two of them together and with a small \n&gt;&gt; &gt; welding\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tool, he fashions a make shift lance.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;What&#39;dya think?&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride grins.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; That&#39;ll do.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap grins also.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Rat Trap Maximize.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; He gets into his robot mode, and gets up onto Quickstride&#39;s back, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; holding\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the lance in his left hand while holding onto Quickstride&#39;s mane with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other.  He then realizes that one more thing is missing.  A shield.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Forgot the shield.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride sniffs at a broken off door of a vehicle.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Found one.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Rat Trap is given the car door.  He now tries to hold on with his legs,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rather than hands.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Woahh, I dunno how this is gonna work big guy..  Guess we&#39;ll find out\n&gt;&gt; &gt; eventually.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Quickstride faces the fortress, and stands his ground.  The wind blows\n&gt;&gt; &gt; breezes through his mane as he looks onward, ears forward.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Remember Rat Trap, we don&#39;t make any moves unless they come after us\n&gt;&gt; &gt; first.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Back in the fortress in a different cell, Night Shift keeps an ear out \n&gt;&gt; &gt; on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what goes on behind the door.  He calmly remembers all of his ninjabot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; training, and a few hand excercises he had been taught to make his \n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrists\n&gt;&gt; &gt; more limber and fluid.  He had hoped that these would accidentally, on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; purpose slip one of his hands if not both out of his restraints and be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; able to slip them back in at a moment&#39;s notice, then back out without\n&gt;&gt; &gt; anyone ever catching onto him.  Without a word, he keeps his eyes open,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not one ounce of body language, and attempts his excercises he had \n&gt;&gt; &gt; learned\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from his mentor, Prowl.  He thinks to himself while attempting it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot; Okay Prowl, I ain&#39;t done this one in a while, let&#39;s see if I remember\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that little excercise ya taught me...&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In nbwrpg@yahoogroups.com, &lt;airly2002@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hydras/Perceptor:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hdyras sent a private message to Rodimus.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I want to speak with you when your shift ends.
