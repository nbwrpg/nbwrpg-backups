Meanwhile the insectoids continued thier\n&gt; &gt;&gt; relentless attacks, =\r\non both Vestige and Tuscon!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Suddenly the door slammed open, the s=\r\nounds of buzzing insects could be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; heard, as a swarm of them flew into =\r\nthe room. Blue ones, red ones,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; silver ones, black ones, each of all sh=\r\napes and sizes. However in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; midst of that a female walked, the inse=\r\ncts flying around her obeying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; her and yet giving her a wide birth at t=\r\nhe same time. She was tall,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taller than any of the insects, her moveme=\r\nnts smooth and flowing. She\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was black and red with large insect like w=\r\nings sitting on her back,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; designed something like seeker wings on a tr=\r\nansformer.
