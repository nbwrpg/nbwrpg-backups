Magnaboss is the fusion of Wingsaber's intelligence, Leo's courage and Santon's
kindness. Together they are a powerful fighting machine and a beacon of hope for 
the Maximals. Coming into being when Leo's unique spark reformatted Wingsaber's 
and Santon's internal systems, granting them access to their gestalt form. Though 
not as wise as his namesake, Magnaboss II strives to live up to the ideals set up 
by his predecessor.
