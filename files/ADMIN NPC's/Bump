SIZE: Basic (5.5' Tall)
BEAST MODE: Brazilian giant armadillo

Bump is exceedingly reserved in character. He rarely shows any extremities in 
emotion in any way, be it positive or negative. He believes only in science and 
considers Cybertronian religions and beliefs to be nothing more than over-hyped 
fairy tales. 

The only time Bump is really happy is when he’s retreated into his own private 
little world of theorems, where he can perform all the experiments he wants 
without the distractions of others. Though quiet and often times shy, Bump is 
still good-natured and respectful. Though responsible for many of their greatest 
weapons, he left the Maximal army when he grew tired of being limited to 
constructing machines of war. He now works on commission and only on projects 
that catch his interest. He's quite frugal with his pay and invests it all right 
back into his studies. 

Bump possesses many advanced sensors in his hands and is a quick-draw champion, 
but has very little actual combat experience. As weaponry possesses a simple blaster and a chain-and-mace melee weapon.
