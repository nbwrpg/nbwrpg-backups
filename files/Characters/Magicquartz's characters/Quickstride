Personality: Somewhat flighty, like a thoroughbread race horse, skittish at times, yet personable, has a tendency to be stubborn, and sometimes a bit out to lunch.  With all these quirks he has great things that compensate for his behavior weaknesses.  He's always willing to help his fellow Maximals and lend a hoof to Autobots in need.  He remains faithful to his faction and honors his oath not to take lives needlessly.

Brief History: For the most part, Quickstride leads a very passive life.  He likes nothing more than to spend a day grazing on grass and trotting through open terrain, in his alt form.  In robot mode, he enjoys simply taking things in stride, his home, his environment, and even trying to find ways to conserve his homeland.  All this changes when the wars kick up again, and he finds that due to Predacon and Decepticon Plunder, his world as he knew it, was turned upside down.  This angers him yet he knows that stomping a hoof isn't enough to end the destruction and chaos.  If he's going to get anywhere, he has to team up with his fellow Maximals and team up he does.  His main purpose now is to see things returned somewhat back to normal.
