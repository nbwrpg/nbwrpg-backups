Brief History: Before Tucson's unfortunate accident in the first war, he was often seen working together with his twin counterpart on many missions.  During the war that rendered Tucson blind, out of selflessness, Tucson advised Night Shift to escape toward a different direction to avoid a nasty demise.  Of course Night Shift dreaded this decision and fought not to go, yet was met by his comrade's stubborness and did as was told.  He carries that guilt through to after the war, even though Tucson knows it was the right thing to do to keep him alive and running.  Yet, Night Shift can never let go of his guilt knowing that his comrade may not have suffered as he did if he had not separated from him during the battle.

Anything else: He is also known as a Pretender, working with the Autobots, and masking himself as a Decepticon.
