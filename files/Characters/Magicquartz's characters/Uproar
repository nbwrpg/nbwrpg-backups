Brief History: As a young bot, Uproar comes to meet Tigertron on his land, and learns to respect the environment around him.  He promises that if anything were to happen to him, he would take his place, and protect the precious land Tigertron adored.  As Tigertron vanishes, with Airazor, he keeps his promise, and watches over things carefully.  Yet, he can not help but wonder about things back at the Ark and Lord Elder.  To satisfy his curiosity, he returns to Lord Elder and the Ark, now realizing that his pressense, is much needed there.
