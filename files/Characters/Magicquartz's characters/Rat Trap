Brief History: As with all the Maximals, Rat Trap finds himself far removed from his home planet of Cybertron but finds a way to adapt to his new harsh environment.  When in doubt, just steal what you need and make for a hastey exit.  Even though Rat Trap thinks like a thief, even he knew that what the Predacons and Decepticons had done and what they were doing, was far worse than stealing an occasional bit of energon to survive on.  Like all Maximals, he too, lends a small hand in protecting what is left of his planetary sanctuary and so he too, in his own way, volunteers his services to do what he feels is right for his environment.
