History:  Malice is a long time bounty hunter.  He came to prehistory Earth in search of a bounty and was wrapped up in the war.  He formed a relationship with one of the Maximals, but after a kidnapping and cloning, the relation soon deteriorated.  After his siblings arrive, he and his brother left and have been in hiding for many years.  
Given a vehicle form and the time consuming ability to switch between it and his original form, he and Megatron X now work as hired guns, resuming his old cold and uninterested demeanor save for payment.
