History:  After the capture of Malice, Hellplague, one of Unicron's Minions, cloned him to become a perfect weapon.  His personality and manner is much differant from the original, however.  He is much more sadistic and mad, and focused more on destroying then anything Malice focuses on.  A killing machine, pure and simple.  But not dumb.  He is a scheming, intelligent bot, a danger to anyone on the battle ground.
