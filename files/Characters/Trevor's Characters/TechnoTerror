History: TechnoTeeror was, at one time, a spy drone for the Decepticons.  He had gotten in good with the Autobots, they had given him life.  He had, finally, told the truth to the Autobots that he was a spy and had left their ranks during a battle.  He had returned to the Decepticons for many centuries and many changes and upgrades to his physical body.  Currently, he is with the Decepticons.
